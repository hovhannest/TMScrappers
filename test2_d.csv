In this part film ÃƒÂ  clef, part musical phantasmagoria, director/choreographer Bob Fosse takes a Felliniesque look at the life of a driven entertainer. Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider, channeling Fosse) is the ultimate work (and pleasure)-aholic, as he knocks back a daily dose of amphetamines to juggle a new Broadway production while editing his new movie, not to mention ex-wife Audrey (Leland Palmer), steady girlfriend Kate (Ann Reinking), a young daughter, and various conquests. Joe cannot, however, avoid intimations of mortality from white-clad vision Angelique (Jessica Lange) that lead him to look back at his life as he heads for a near-inevitable coronary and his departure from this mortal coil with the appropriate razzle-dazzle. Taking his cue from Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 (1963), Fosse moves from realistic dance numbers to extravagant flights of cinematic fancy, as Joe meditates on his life, his women, and his death. Following a similarly dark revisionist vein as Martin Scorsese's New York, New York (1977), Fosse shows the stiff price that entertaining exacts on entertainers (among other things, he intercuts graphic footage of open-heart surgery with a song and dance), mercilessly reversing the feel-good mood of classical movie musicals. Critics praised Fosse's daring even as they damned his self-indulgence, while Scheider was lauded for giving the best performance of his career. Though not a disastrous failure, All That Jazz came nowhere near the popularity of 1978's Grease, as late '70s audiences increasingly turned away from ""difficult"" movies. For all its excesses, Fosse's fiercely personal approach turned All That Jazz into another striking work from one of the few directors able to make, and experiment with, movie musicals after the 1960s.";Bob Fosse;Bob Fosse,Robert Alan Aurthur;/celebrity/bob_fosse,/celebrity/robert_alan_aurthur;as Joe Gideon,as Angelique,as Kate,as Audrey,as Michelle,as Michelle,as Davis Newman,as O'Connor Flood,as Victoria,as Joe (as a boy),as Dr. Ballinger,as Leslie,as Lucas Sergeant,as Joshua,as Jonesy,as Kathryn,as Paul,as Jonesy Hecht,as Ted Christopher,as Larry Goldie,as Stacy,,as Comic,as Sandahl,as Eddie,as Doctor Garry,as Cast of NY/LA,as Nurse Blake,as Assistant Insurance Man,as Mother;All That Jazz;https://resizing.flixster.com/I9arHgAKgdeBB6GLEpObQKUpzbM=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjQzMDtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTIzNjsxNjQ4

Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), once an Imperial Guard in China, is now the Sheriff of Carson City, NV, while his onetime cohort, former train robber Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), scrapes together a living writing dime novels based on his adventures and waiting tables in New York City. However, when Wang learns that his father was killed by bandits who broke into the Emperor's palace and stole the Imperial Seal, he's determined to bring the criminals to justice. Wang's sister Lin (Fann Wong) has learned that the killers have escaped to London, so Wang travels to England to meet her, with O'Bannon in tow. As Wang and Lin -- whose martial arts skills rival those of her brother -- look for the culprits, they discover that Lord Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), who is looking to shorten his path of succession to the British throne, is in cahoots with Wu Chan (Donnie Yen), the bastard son of the Chinese Emperor's father, who needs the Imperial Seal as part of his plan to win control of the nation. As Wang and Lin try to get to the bottom of Chan's schemes, O'Bannon finds himself infatuated with his pal's sister.

Julia Roberts stars as Grace King Bichon, a prim small-town wife who is incensed when she learns that her husband Eddie Bichon (Dennis Quaid) is having an affair, and that it's not his first dalliance. Grace embarrasses her husband publicly -- then moves in with her wise-mouthed little sister Emma Rae (the scene-stealing Kyra Sedgwick). Grace becomes even angrier when her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and wealthy father, horse breeder Wyly King (Robert Duvall), side with Eddie in the conflict, fearing the small-town gossip that's sure to swirl around their daughter's marital woes. However, when Georgia finds that Wyly has been a long-term philanderer as well, she kicks him out of his palatial home, embroiling the entire King family in a war between the sexes. Something to Talk About went through several title changes, variously being named ""Game of Love"" and ""Grace Under Pressure"" before producers settled on the title of the popular Bonnie Raitt song. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Lasse Hallstrom;Callie Khouri;/celebrity/callie_khouri;as Grace King Bichon,as Eddie Bichon,as Wyly King,as Georgia King,as Emma Rae,as Jamie Johnson,as Caroline,as Hank Corrigan,as Dr. Frank Lewis,as Aunt Rae,as Eula,as Dr. Frank Lewis,as Babaranelle,as Edna,as Kitty,as Lorene Tuttle,as Lucy,as Mary Jane,as Nadine,as Norma Leggett,as Sonny,as Frank,as June,as Dub,as Harry,as Announcer,as Mrs. Pinkerton,as Jessie Gaines,as Anne,as College Friend;Something to Talk About;https://resizing.flixster.com/9iE9c3euY6blQTI6kISZkat_BKs=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2NzkzNDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Jeff Bridges is shock radio DJ Jack Lucas, whose low opinion of humanity lends itself well to his radio talk show, where the enmity rubs off on his listeners. One fan in particular takes Jack's rants to heart and goes to a fancy restaurant with a gun, murdering innocent diners. Jack is so distraught at what his on-air suggestion wrought that he sinks into a three-year depression, drinking himself to sleep and mooching off of his girlfriend Anne Napolitano (Mercedes Ruehl, in an Oscar-winning performance), an attractive owner of a video store. Hitting bottom, Jack slumps to the river, prepared to commit suicide.

Led by Cinque, they arm themselves, take control of the ship and reclaim their freedom. They have one goal: to return to Africa. Without the navigational skills to guide them home, the Africans are forced to rely on the two surviving members of the crew. But they are tricked. After two months on a ragged course up the Eastern seaboard, the Amistad is captured by an American naval ship off the coast of Connecticut and the Africans were charged for murder and piracy. In the beginning, the Africans are championed by abolitionists Theodore Joadson and Lewis Tappan, and a young real estate attorney named Roger Baldwin. However, as the case becomes the symbol of a nation divided, two great Americans lock horns in the debate. Pro-slavery President Martin Van Buren, seeking re-election, is willing to sacrifice the Africans to appease the South, as well as Queen Isabella of Spain. But his will is challenged by former President John Quincy Adams, who comes out of retirement to fight the Africans' cause in the United State Supreme Court.;Steven Spielberg;David H.

Ben Affleck stars as Holden McNeil, a New Jersey comic book writer who is roommates with his best friend and professional partner, artist Banky Edwards (Jason Lee). Their hit comic book series, ""Bluntman and Chronic,"" is loosely patterned after a pair of acquaintances, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Smith), two characters already familiar as supporting players in several Smith films. Into Holden's life comes Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a lesbian and fellow comic book creator who quickly becomes a close friend, although Holden is powerfully attracted to her. Eventually, Alyssa realizes that she is attracted to Holden as well and they begin a physical relationship, much to the consternation of Banky, whose ire over losing his best friend to a lesbian seems to border on romantic jealousy. After he learns something about Alyssa's sexual past, however, Holden's immature response to his new knowledge destroys both his romance with Alyssa and his friendship with Banky. Chasing Amy (1997) was the third film in what Smith referred to as his ""New Jersey series,"" films set at least partly in the Garden State and featuring the Jay and Silent Bob characters. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Kevin Smith;Kevin Smith;/celebrity/1030366-kevin_smith;as Holden McNeill,as Alyssa Jones,as Banky Edwards,as Hooper,as Jay,as Silent Bob,as Fan,as Collector,as Little Kid,as Singer,as Angry Woman,as Kim,as Executive No. 1,as Executive No. 2,as Train Attendant,as Cashier,as Dalia,as Tory,as Jane,,as Nica,as Cohee Lundin,as Young Black Kid,as Bystander,as Waitress,as Con Woman;Chasing Amy;https://resizing.flixster.com/ubQBLl2QAXWq2BQpdCkVEfzrCBY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3Nzk1MjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

It is a time of change across America--sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll--and a historic year in the space program, but not everything is in upheaval. Pearl Katrowitz, a thirty-year-old Brooklyn housewife (Diane Lane), is spending the summer, as she has for the last decade, at Dr. Fleigel's Bungalow Colony in the Catskills. Along with her daughter, son, and mother-in-law, she waits dutifully for her husband's weekend visits, commuting from his job in New York City. The insularity of the camp is interrupted only by calls from the traveling salesman, the ""ice cream man,"" ""the knish man,"" or ""the dress man."" On one of these occasions, Pearl meets ""the blouse man,"" Walker (Viggo Mortensen). Both hip and sexy, he is at first just casually friendly. But it rapidly becomes evident that the undercurrent of sexual tension won't disappear, and the steamy love affair that ensues changes the lives of everyone involved. With a tone that is romantic yet very authentic, Goldwyn creates a charmingly comic but intense love story that interweaves coming of age for Pearl's newly adolescent daughter with Pearl's own trek toward self-realization. Against the backdrop of Woodstock, and with Lane's complex, yet compelling, sexuality, Goldwyn's storytelling avoids the era's easy cliches to offer a memorable and satisfying look back at the time when change was in the air.";Tony Goldwyn;Pamela Gray (II) ;/celebrity/pamela_gray_ii;as Pearl Kantrowitz,as Walker Jerome,as Alison Kantrowitz,as Marty Kantrowitz,as Danny Kantrowitz,,as Lilian,as Neil Leiberman,as Herb Fogler,as Mrs. Dymbort,as Rhoda Leiberman,as Eleanor Gelfand,as Norma Fogler,as Selma Levitsky,as Wendy Green,as Myra Naidell,as Ross Epstein,as Carl Applebaum,as Jeffrey Folger,as Sheldon Dymbort,as Comedian,as Shapiro, Sid,as Customer No. 1,as Customer No. 2;A Walk on the Moon;https://resizing.flixster.com/Ea2tEyzN_etb10RGu7szux85Og0=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjQyNDtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7OTAwOzEyMDA

When his release comes through, he's eager to see the daughter he's never met. However, Poe's original flight is delayed, so he's put aboard a flight transporting ten of the most dangerous men in the American penal system to a new high-security facility. One of the criminals, Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich), is a serial killer and insane genius who has hatched a diabolical plot: with the help of several other hoods, including Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Johnny 23 (Daniel Trejo), and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), Cyrus and his men will hijack the plane and fly to a neutral nation where they can live as free men. Poe finds himself stuck in the middle; he has to find a way to get home, keep himself alive, look after his cellmate Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson), who will die without proper medicine, and try to help the cops on the ground, including agent Vince Larkin (John Cusack).

Aileen Wuornos (Theron) was a woman who survived a brutal and abusive childhood in Michigan to become a thick-skinned but emotionally damaged adult. Homeless most of her life, Wuornos subsisted by working as a street prostitute; later, when she was in Florida, down to her last five dollars and pondering suicide, she stopped into a bar for a beer. There, Aileen met Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her Christian parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen tells Selby she's never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally infatuated with her. Selby runs away from her family and moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who initially pays the bills by hooking. However, as their money runs low and Aileen finds herself unable to land a regular job, tensions mount between the two. One night, after a john attacks her, Aileen pulls a gun and kills the man. Although her first murder can be categorized as self-defense, Aileen's loathing for the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her lover's instability and the bloody consequences of her actions. Monster was inspired by the true story of Aileen Wuornos, whose life and death was chronicled in two documentaries by filmmaker Nick Broomfield, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, and Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Patty Jenkins;Patty Jenkins;/celebrity/patty_jenkins;as Aileen Wuornos,as Selby Wall,as Thomas,as Horton (Last John),as Gene (Stuttering John),as Vincent Corey,as Donna Tentler,as Evan,as Cubby,as Will Grueser,as Charles,as Lead Prosecutor,as Cute Teenager Attendant,as Justy,as Biker,as Chuck;Monster;https://resizing.flixster.com/mM46CAXUe9fk6wvatZvNvWzYNMA=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDc5MTtqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7Nzk4OzEwNjQ

As years pass and the former military hospital is transformed into a civilian mental treatment center, the legend of the mysterious virus becomes little more than urban legend to the unsuspecting patients.

Whoopi Goldberg is Terry Doolittle, an office worker with her share of eccentric colleagues and now an added problem: some spy has tapped into her computer and is asking her for help. Terry decides the only womanly thing to do is to get in there and save the man and so she heads into a whole series of unlikely situations. Run-ins with an odd repairman (Jim Belushi), an invalid diplomat, and a KGB mole have her impersonating people like Diana Ross and generally wreaking havoc on the whole spy game.

To sustain their sanguinary requirements, the pair cruises New York nightclubs in search of victims (as illustrated in a stunning opening sequence to the accompaniment of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" performed by seminal Goth band Bauhaus). When John awakens one morning to discover telltale signs of aging, it is revealed that his own sustained youth is not permanent, and his physical decrepitude begins to increase at an incredible rate. In a panic, John visits the clinic of scientist Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), who has recently published a book on reversing the aging process, but she initially dismisses him as a crank, leaving him to sit in the lobby for several hours... during which his body ages several decades. After learning of his condition, Sarah traces John to his uptown flat. John is nowhere to be found, having been consigned by Miriam to a box in the attic with her legions of undead loves, leaving Miriam to deal with Sarah -- which she does quite effectively, seducing her into a steamy lesbian tryst. Their passion is consummated by a mingling of Miriam's blood with Sarah's, which later manifests itself as a psychic link between the two women and leaves Sarah with a rapidly-increasing appetite for blood. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi";Tony Scott;;;as Miriam,as John,as Sarah Roberts,as Tom Haver,as Alice Cavender,as Lt.

Spanning four decades, the film tells the story of David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and his Jewish pals, chronicling their childhoods on New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s, through their gangster careers in the 1930s, and culminating in Noodles' 1968 return to New York from self-imposed exile, at which time he learns the truth about the fate of his friends and again confronts the nightmare of his past. The acting, the re-creation of the time period, the cinematography, and the music are all superb. However, even more important is Leone's ability to make the film work on so many different levels: it's both a criticism of gangster-film mythology and a continuation of the director's exploration of the issues of time and history. Strange as it may seem, the violence and gore in the first half of the film turn into a sad elegy about wasted lives and lost love. The film's strengths emerge only in its full 229-minute version -- the 139-minute and other edited versions don't make nearly the same impact. ~ Yuri German, Rovi";Sergio Leone;Leo Benvenuti,Franco Arcalli,Sergio Leone,Franco Ferrini,Piero De Bernardi;/celebrity/leo_benvenuti,/celebrity/franco_arcalli,/celebrity/sergio_leone,/celebrity/franco_ferrini,/celebrity/piero_de_bernardi;"as David ""Noodles"" Aaronson,as Max,as Deborah,as Jimmy O'Donnell,as Carol,as Joe,as Frankie,as Police Chief Aiello,as Cockeye,as Patsy,as Patsy,as Eve,as Fat Moe,as Van Linden,as Peggy,as Sharkey,as Chicken Joe,as Crowning,as Peggy,as Woman in the Puppet Theater,as Mandy,as Trigger,as Beefy,as Mrs. Aiello,as Willie the Ape,,as Young Noodles,as Young Max/David,as Young Patsy,as Young Cockeye,,as Young Fat Moe,as Young Deborah,as Dominic,as Bugsy,as Bugsy's Gang,as Bugsy's Gang,as Al Capuano,as Fred Capuano,as Johnny Capuano,as Young Peggy,as Interviewer,as Irving Gold,as Monkey,as Girl in Coffin,as Adorable Old Man,as Nurse Thompson,as Reporter,as Reporter,as Reporter,as Chauffeur,as Thug,as Cemetery Caretaker,as Max's Mother,as Peggy's Mother,as Whitey,as Drunk,as Ticket Agent,as Newstand Man,as Mounted Policeman,as 2nd Mounted Policeman,as Sgt.

While the courtship and reproductive patterns of animals had been carefully documented, Kinsey believed that most ""established facts"" about human sexual behavior were a matter of conjecture rather than research and that what most people said about their sex lives was not born out by the evidence (a subject that had personal resonance for him given the troubles he and his wife Clara Kinsey had in the early days of their marriage). After introducing a course in ""Marriage"" at Indiana University which offered frank and factual information on sex to students, Kinsey began an exhaustive series of interviews with a wide variety of people from all walks of life in order to find out the truth about sex practices in America. When he published Sexual Behavior and the Human Male in 1948, his findings were wildly controversial, indicating that most men had a wider variety of sexual experiences than most people imagined, including a number of practices commonly thought to be dangerous or perverted (including pre-marital sex, same-sex contacts, and masturbation). An even greater outcry greeted Kinsey's next volume, Sexual Behavior and the Human Female, which contradicted common notions than most women went into marriage sexually inexperienced. Kinsey is a film biography written and directed by Bill Condon which examines Kinsey's life and work from his strict childhood until his death in 1956. Liam Neeson plays Alfred Kinsey, and Laura Linney co-stars as Kinsey's wife and colleague Clara. John Lithgow highlights the supporting cast as Kinsey's repressed and moralistic father, while Chris O'Donnell, Peter Sarsgaard, and Timothy Hutton play members of Kinsey's research team and Tim Curry appears as an IU faculty member at odds with Kinsey's teachings. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Bill Condon;Bill Condon;/celebrity/bill_condon;as Alfred Kinsey,as Clara McMillen,as Wardell Pomeroy,as Clyde Martin,as Paul Gebhard,as Alfred Seguine Kinsey,as Thurman Rice,as Herman Wells,as Alan Gregg,as Alice Martin,as Kenneth Braun,as Huntington Hartford,as Sara Kinsey,as Barbara Merkle,as Martha Pomeroy,as Agnes Gebhard,as Young Man In Gay Bar,as Final Interview Subject,as Kinsey At 19,as Kenneth Braun,as Kinsey At 14,as Kinsey At 10,as Ben,as Staff Secretary,as Emily,as Rep.

Buddy has no transportation, so he's forced to ride with Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer), a phlegmatic hulk of a man who is using his 1964 Buick as a vehicle for a spiritual journey of his own. Philbert's easygoing ways and insistence on frequent stops to meditate prove irritating at first to Buddy, but the men reach an accommodation as the trip wears on.

Stripped of his job and a good measure of his identity, the tenacious but hanging-by-a-thread Jerry is forced to start from scratch.

The disgruntled Matthau quits the service and heads to Europe, where he links up with former lover (an fellow ex-agent) Glenda Jackson. All goes smoothly until Matthau acts on the advice of yet another retired agent, Russian Herbert Lom, who suggests that Matthau write a tell-all autobiography. Spitefully, Matthau sends out copies of his first chapter to the heads of the CIA agencies throughout the world--and from that point on, he and Jackson don't have a moment's peace. This delights Matthau: now that all of his former colleagues are chasing after him, he has a reason to get up in the morning.

Taking its ""innocent man accidentally caught up in political corruption"" story from such films as Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Sydney Pollack's Three Days of the Condor, they turn up the high-tech volume in an attempt to create the ultimate action film. Robert Clayton Dean, played by Will Smith, is a devoted father, husband, and attorney shopping for a sexy gift for his wife. What he doesn't know is that he was given a videotape from a friend (Jason Lee) regarding the recent murder of a U.S. senator led by corrupt National Security Agency official Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight).

Based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, whose works inspired Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca and The Birds, the film centers on Laura and John Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie), who have recently relocated to Venice so that John can oversee the architectural restoration of an old church. Both hope that the change of environment will allow them to forget the recent tragic demise of their child, but they instead find themselves surrounded by reminders of death, as the city attempts to deal with a series of unexplained murders. The eeriness intensifies when they encounter a blind psychic and her eccentric sister, who promise to contact her daughter's spirit. Laura embraces the idea, but John remains skeptical until he experiences his own visions: fleeting glimpses of someone in a red coat similar to one that belonged to his daughter. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi;Nicolas Roeg;Chris Bryant,Allan Scott;/celebrity/chris_bryant,/celebrity/1060309-allan_scott;as Laura Baxter,as John Baxter,as Heather,as Wendy,as Bishop Barbarrigo,,as Inspector Longhi,as Workman,as Hotel Manager,as Anthony Babbage,as Mandy Babbage,as Johnny Boxter,as Christine Baxter,as Detective Sabbione,as Dwarf;Don't Look Now;https://resizing.flixster.com/4L4X1bJKGiIy11FCwgMtL11coa4=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIyNzEwNTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTQ1ODsxOTQ0

Faber, (Donald Sutherland) is a Nazi spy stationed in Britain who uncovers the Allies' plans to invade Normandy. His cover is blown when his landlady catches him using a shortwave radio and he is forced to kill her. Trusting no one, her murders several people as he flees, trying to escape from Britain and pass on his information to his Nazi superiors. Faber steals a fishing boat intending to rendezvous with a U-boat at a remote island. However, the boat sinks during a violent storm and Faber is stranded and forced to seek shelter with Lucy (Kate Nelligan), the lonely, sexually frustrated wife of a paraplegic ex-fighter pilot (Christopher Cazenove). A love affair between Lucy and Faber complicates his plans and the film draws to an dramatic, surprising climax as Lucy discovers Faber's true identity. Directed with considerable flair by Richard Marquand, this adaptation of Ken Follett's best-selling novel the film is both an effective thriller and a touching, highly erotic love story. The sexual encounters between Lucy and Faber are sensual, beautifully photographed and romantic. Eye of the Needle also includes one of Sutherland's best performances cold-blooded spy who who falls in love.

In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), better known as ""Bill the Butcher"" for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow ""Native Americans"" into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, ""The Dead Rabbits,"" organized by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio). Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny. Gangs Of New York was the first film in two years from actor Leonardo DiCaprio; ironically, it was at one time scheduled to open on the same day as Catch Me if You Can, the Steven Spielberg project that DiCaprio began filming immediately after Gangs wrapped. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Martin Scorsese;Jay Cocks,Steven Zaillian,Kenneth Lonergan;/celebrity/jay_cocks,/celebrity/steven_zaillian,/celebrity/kenneth_lonergan;"as Amsterdam Vallon,as William Cutting (""Bill the Butcher""),as Jenny Everdeane,as William ""Boss"" Tweed,as ""Priest"" Vallon,as Happy Jack Mulraney,as Johnny Sirocco,as Walter ""Monk"" McGinn,as P.T.

This abrupt meeting sets her off on an extraordinary journey of mystery, comedy and suspense as she is transported to a fantastical world of celestial characters and spirited adventure.

Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire. ~ Bhob Stewart, Rovi;Stephen Norrington;David S.

Lago's residents are not particularly friendly, but once the Stranger shows his skills as a gunfighter, they beg him to defend them against a group of outlaws (led by Eastwood regular Geoffrey Lewis) who have a score to settle with the town. He agrees to train them in self-defense, but Mordecai and innkeeper's wife Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom) soon suspect that the Stranger has another, more personal agenda. By the time the Stranger makes the corrupt community paint their town red and re-name it ""Hell,"" it is clear that he is not just another gunslinger. With its fragmented flashbacks and bizarre, austere locations, High Plains Drifter's stylistic eccentricity lends an air of unsettling eeriness to its revenge story, adding an uncanny slant to Eastwood's antiheroic westerner. Seminal western hero John Wayne was so offended by Eastwood's harshly revisionist view of a frontier town that he wrote to Eastwood, objecting that this was not what the spirit of the West was all about. Eastwood's audience, however, was not so put off, and an exhibitors' poll named Eastwood a top box-office draw for 1973. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi";Clint Eastwood;Ernest Tidyman;/celebrity/ernest_tidyman;as The Stranger,as Sarah Belding,as Callie Travers,as Dave Drake,as Morgan Allen,as Lewis Belding,as Mordecai,as Mayor Jason Hobart,as Stacey Bridges,,as Sheriff Sam Shaw,as Lutie Naylor,as Asa Goodwin,as Preacher,as Bootmaker,as Cole Carlin,as Barber,as Freight Wagon Operator,as Townswoman,as Dan Carlin,as Gunsmith,as Tommy Morris,as Saddlemaker,as Fred Short,as Mrs. Lake,as Warden,as Teamster,as Stableman,as Marshal Jim Duncan;High Plains Drifter;https://resizing.flixster.com/738A56lXGf9J6cse5BndppeJsuY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MzcyMjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

It also caused major controversy by redefining violence in cinema and casting its criminal protagonists as sympathetic anti-heroes. Based loosely on the true exploits of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker during the 30s, the film begins as Clyde (Beatty) tries to steal the car of Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway)'s mother. Bonnie is excited by Clyde's outlaw demeanor, and he further stimulates her by robbing a store in her presence. Clyde steals a car, with Bonnie in tow, and their legendary crime spree begins. The two move from town to town, pulling off small heists, until they join up with Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his shrill wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and a slow-witted gas station attendant named C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard). The new gang robs a bank and Clyde is soon painted in the press as a Depression-era Robin Hood when he allows one bank customer to hold onto his money. Soon the police are on the gang's trail and they are constantly on the run, even kidnapping a Texas Ranger (Denver Pyle) and setting him adrift on a raft, handcuffed, after he spits in Bonnie's face when she kisses him. That same ranger leads a later raid on the gang that leaves Buck dying, Blanche captured, and both Clyde and Bonnie injured. The ever-loyal C.W. takes them to his father's house. C.W.'s father disaproves his son's affiliation with gangsters and enters a plea bargain with the Texas Rangers. A trap is set that ends in one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history. The film made stars out of Beatty and Dunaway, and it also featured the screen debut of Gene Wilder as a mortician briefly captured by the gang. Its portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde as rebels who empathized with the poor working folks of the 1930s struck a chord with the counterculture of the 1960s and helped generate a new, young audience for American movies that carried over into Hollywood's renewal of the 1970s. Its combination of sex and violence with dynamic stars, social relevance, a traditional Hollywood genre, and an appeal to hip young audiences set the pace for many American movies to come. ~ Don Kaye, Rovi;Arthur Penn;David Newman,Robert Benton;/celebrity/,/celebrity/robert_benton;as Clyde Barrow,as Bonnie Parker,as C.W.

Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen), already on the edge, is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local, lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs, a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers, and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild, reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound, he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end, but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to ""Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all."" Coppola himself was not certain either, and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press, the Palme d'Or-winning ""work-in-progress"" shown at Cannes, and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches, which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself, have been superbly captured in the documentary, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending, Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Duvall's psychotic Kilgore, and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. This hallucinatory, Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made, and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi";Francis Ford Coppola;John Milius,Francis Ford Coppola,Michael Herr;/celebrity/john_milius,/celebrity/francis_ford_coppola,/celebrity/michael_herr;as Capt.

At the end of The Hustler, Felson was banned for life from playing the game professionally. In the intervening years, he has become what the despicable George C. Scott was in the 1961 film: a front man for younger hustlers, claiming the lion's share of the winnings. His latest ""client"" is arrogant young Tom Cruise, who is goaded into accepting Felson's patronage by his avaricious girl friend Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Cruise learns not only the refinements of the game, but also the dirty trickery that will help him lure in the suckers. As Cruise becomes successful on these terms, Felson seethes with jealousy, hitting the bottle and carelessly allowing himself to fall victim to another hustler. He tells Cruise to get lost, and vows to make an honest comeback. It is inevitable from this point onward that the younger and the older player will square off in a game for the biggest stakes of all: Fast Eddie Felson's self-respect.

Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a thief who specializes in big, risky jobs, such as banks and armored cars. He's very good at what he does; he's bright, methodical, and has honed his skills as a thief at the expense of his personal life, vowing never to get involved in a relationship from which he couldn't walk away in 30 seconds. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is an L.A.P.D. detective determined to catch McCauley, but while McCauley's personal code has forced him to do without a wife and children, Hanna's dedication has made a wreck of the home he's tried to have; he's been divorced twice, he's all but a stranger to his third wife, and he has no idea how to reach out to his troubled step-daughter. While McCauley has enough money to retire and is planning to move to New Zealand, he loves the thrill of robbery as much as the profit, and is blocking out plans for one more job; meanwhile, he's met a woman, Eady (Amy Brenneman), whom he's not so sure he can walk away from.

Laurence Fishburne stars as the Moorish general Othello, who returns a hero after crushing an invasion attempt by the Turkish army near Cyprus. Pledged to marry the lovely Desdemona (Irene Jacob), Othello ignores the advice of his intended's father, who tells him that she may have a deceptive nature. Othello's aide Iago (Kenneth Branagh), jealous over the elevation of his rival, Cassio (Nathaniel Parker, the director's real-life brother) to lieutenant, begins scheming to make Othello believe that Desdemona and Cassio are carrying on an affair. On the slimmest of evidence, Iago manages to manipulate Othello's suspicious, distrustful nature. Played previously in black face on film by actors Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier, Parker's production of Othello (1995) was the first major cinematic production to cast an African-American in the title role.;Oliver Parker;Oliver Parker;/celebrity/oliver_parker;as Othello,as Desdemona,as Iago,as Cassio,as Roderigo,as Emilia,as Montano,as Bianca,as Lodovico,as Gratiano,as 1st Senator,as 2nd Senator,as The Duke of Venice,as Brabantio;Othello;https://resizing.flixster.com/WyQUuyUm-6vUEVrL01vN0AKIh7Q=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjQwNjtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Lucy (Dianne Wiest) and her sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), move to Santa Carla to live with Lucy's lovable but curmudgeonly father (Barnard Hughes). Lucy gets a job from video-store owner Max (Edward Herrmann), then begins dating him, while Sam hangs out with Edward and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), a pair of vampire-obsessed comic-shop clerks. Soon Michael falls in with some actual vampires after becoming enamored of one of their victims: Star (Jami Gertz), a gypsy-like vixen who is trying to hold on to her humanity even though vampire leader David (Kiefer Sutherland) wants to play Peter Pan to her Wendy. When Michael visits the cavernous hangout of David and his cronies and unwittingly drinks from a wine bottle full of vampiric blood, he becomes an unwilling member of the bloodsucker biker gang. Soon, it's up to Sam and the Frog brothers to destroy David and his ilk without killing Michael and Star. Shot on location in the coastal California town of Santa Cruz and directed by Hollywood pro Joel Schumacher, The Lost Boys became a pop-culture phenomenon thanks to its attractive young stars, offbeat soundtrack, and hip, clever marketing campaign. The film's tagline -- ""Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire."" -- perfectly captured its knowing mixture of attitude and gore. The effects team who transformed Sutherland and company into snarling bloodsuckers would go on to provide equally gruesome effects for Blade, another revisionist vampire flick, more than a decade later. ~ Brian J.

In 1991, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) was an American soldier serving in the Persian Gulf when he was shot in the head; pronounced dead by a field surgeon, Starks somehow returned to life, though with no small number of psychological problems to show for his troubles. A year later, Starks is walking through the snowy Vermont wilderness when he discovers a woman whose truck has broken down, Jean (Kelly Lynch). Starks tries to help Jean and her young daughter, and later flags down a car for a ride into town; however, the car is being driven by a criminal on the run from the police (Brad Renfro), and not long after the car is cornered by police, Starks' memory goes blank. When he comes to, Jack is accused of killing a patrolman in the violent standoff that followed, and is told that the woman, her daughter, and the criminal existed only in his imagination. Declared insane in his murder trial, Starks is sentenced to a mental institution run by Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson), who seems to believe that the more brutal the treatment, the better. As Starks suffers frequent beatings and long spells in a frozen locker, his mind drifts from his harrowing past into the future, where he visits with Jackie (Keira Knightley), who once was the young girl Starks tried to help.

If anything, this brutal sci-fi action film is even more intense and exciting than its predecessor, although the state of its post-apocalyptic world has only become worse. Several years after the deaths of his wife and child, Max (Mel Gibson) has become an alienated nomad, wandering an Australian outback that has fallen into tribal warfare conducted from scattered armed camps. After a road battle with psychotic villain Wez (Vernon Wells), Max meets up with the odd Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), who takes him to the camp of a sympathetic group led by Pappagallo (Mike Preston). As Pappagallo's people are camped at a refinery, Max plans to take their oil -- more precious than gold in this world -- but eventually joins them to fight a band of marauders led by the evil Humungus (Kjell Nilsson). The stunning climax features a heart-pounding chase scene involving an oil tanker-truck and a frenzied rush for the coast, with Humungus and his forces in hot pursuit. Nilsson is a scary villain, with huge muscles and a sinister pre-Jason hockey mask, but the stunt work is the key here, and it is more flamboyantly dynamic than ever, edited at breakneck pace and staged with manic fury by Miller and stunt coordinator Max Aspin. Savage and kinetic, Mad Max 2 is a must-see for action buffs. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi;George Miller;Terry Hayes,George Miller,Brian Hannant;/celebrity/terry_hayes,/celebrity/george_miller,/celebrity/brian_hannant;as Max Rockatansky,as Gyro Captain,as Wez,as Feral Kid,as Pappagallo,as Humungus,as Warrior Woman,as Curmudgeon,as Big Rebecca,as Quiet Man,as Lusty Girl,,as Mechanic,as Toadie,as Farmer,as Golden Youth,as Wounded Man,as Defiant Victim,as Narrator,as Broken Victim,as Mechanic's Assistant,as Pappagallo,as Mohawk Biker with Bearclaw,as Mohawk Biker,as Tent Lover,as Tent Lover,as Young Woman;Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior;https://resizing.flixster.com/GFlSSJj0rN3g3cnV9L14h-rs8pI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MjY0MztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Their once-great marriage has been strained by tragedy. The Coles lovingly parent their surviving child, bright 4-year-old Ruth, who takes everything in stride as perhaps only a child can. But Marion's equation of love with loss, coupled with Ted's infidelities, points towards a much-needed change in the relationship. That may come in the form of Eddie O'Hare, the young man Ted hires to work as his summer assistant--and, Ted hopes, the catalyst to invigorate the Coles' bond of marriage. Eddie idolizes Ted, but Ted's erratic work habits soon leave Eddie to his own devices. Marion becomes an object of desire for Eddie, rekindling in her some surprising emotions as a mother and as a woman. To Eddie's surprise and delight, his yearning is potently reciprocated. As he becomes passionately entwined with the seemingly fragile yet increasingly bold Marion, Eddie comes to realize that, and similarly, Ted's surface fecklessness hides something deeper within. As the summer draws to a close, Marion and Ted must make difficult decisions about the future of their family.;Tod Williams;Tod Williams;/celebrity/tod_williams;as Ted Cole,as Marion Cole,as Eddie O'Hare,as Evelyn Vaughn,as Alice,as Ruth Cole,as Eduardo Gomez,as Minty O'Hare,as Effie,as Mendelssohn,as Dr. Loomis,as Glorie Mountsier,as Mrs. Mountsier,as Interviewer,as Reception Fan,as Woman at Reception,as Bookstore Assistant,as Frame Shop Clerk,as Frame Shop Owner,as Bookstore Customer,as Thomas Cole,as Timothy Cole;The Door in the Floor;https://resizing.flixster.com/rNHgzHdJTezks3bEMpknKj-ImSQ=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM5NDtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Tom Cruise stars as David Ames, a womanizing playboy who finds romantic redemption when he falls in love with his best friend's girlfriend Sofia (Penelope Cruz, reprising her role from the original film). Before that relationship can begin, however, David is coaxed into a car driven by an ex-lover, Julie (Cameron Diaz), who turns out to be suicidal. Driving her car off a bridge, Julie kills herself and horribly disfigures David. Reconstructive surgery and the loving support of Sofia seem to reverse David's luck, but eerie incidents are soon making him question the reality of his existence and his control over his life, even while he is suspected of complicity in Julie's death. Vanilla Sky (2001) bears the expected Crowe trademark of an obsession with recent pop culture and particularly rock music, a more important element of the remake than the original film. That project's writer/director, Alejandro Amenabar, crafted his own supernatural hit the same year with The Others (2001), starring Nicole Kidman, the soon-to-be-ex-wife of Cruise. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;Cameron Crowe;Alejandro AmenÃƒÂ¡bar,Mateo Gil,Cameron Crowe;/celebrity/alejandro_amenabar,/celebrity/mateo_gil,/celebrity/cameron_crowe;as David Aames,as Sofia Serrano,as Julie Gianni,as Dr. Curtis McCabe,as Brian Shelby,as Edmund Ventura,as Thomas Tipp,as Rebecca Dearborn,as Aaron,as Colleen,as Lynette,as Emma,as David's Assistant,as Peter Brown,as Jamie Berliner,as Dr. Pomeranz,as Other Doctor,as Third Doctor,as Barman,as Doctor from Berlin,as Man in Blue Coat,as Libby,as Art Editor,as Beatrice,as Carlton Kaller,as Raymond Tooley,as Himself,as Benny's Owner,as Dude, Fix Your Face Guy,as Silent Ed Vallencourt,as Young David,as Rayna,as Cryo Man,as Sofia's Friend,as Sofia's Friend,as Dancer,as Martini Waiter,as Sneezy,as Bashful,as Sleepy,as Happy,as Doc,as Dopey,as Grumpy,as Dr. Jennifer Ash,as Party Videographer,as Model,as Model,as Model,as Lucid Dreamer,as Frozen Pediatric Cardiologist,as Frozen Vintage Car Man,as Frozen Theologist,as Frozen Risk Taker,as Frozen Dad,as Laughing Guy,as Carly,as Herself,as Himself,as Himself,as Herself,as Himself,as Party Guest (uncredited),as Chef,as Coat Check Girl,as L.E.

One night in 1973, teenagers Tommy (Steve Braun) and Alan (Larry Sullivan) meet at an L.A. party. While Tommy is openly gay and organizes for gay civil rights, Alan, an aspiring journalist, is a repressed, button-down member of the Young Republicans who is working on his first book, a thick volume about the evils of homosexuality. On the pretext of interviewing him for his book, Alan invites Tommy to his house for dinner, where the sexual tension between the two is so throbbingly blatant that Alan's girlfriend makes a hasty exit. An intense romance between the two men follows. When we next see them, it's 1976, and Alan's book has been published anonymously and is being used by right-wingers who are supporting Anita Bryant's ""Save Our Children"" campaign in Florida. Unfortunately, Tommy finds out that Alan wrote the book and leaves him, and subsequently takes up with Peter (Ray Baker) an affluent closet case. It isn't until the '90s that Alan and Tommy meet again, and are confronted by the romance they thought they had long left behind.

In the female lead, Joanne Whalley returned to films after a three-year absence, choosing to do so with director Amiel. Farrar's Hitchcockian-style story focuses on naive Blockbuster Video clerk Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) who travels from Des Moines, Iowa, to London to celebrate his birthday with his wealthy younger brother, James (Peter Gallagher). When he turns up on the same night that James has plans to attend a high-profile client dinner party (that he hopes will bring him millions from a German investment firm), James needs to keep Wallace away during the evening, so he gives Wallace a ticket to the participatory Theater of Life. The theater game requires Wallace to assume a character and interact with actors portraying people in dramatic situations. At the corner phone booth, the initial call should begin the evening of innocent fun. However, the phone instructions Wallace receives are actually intended for an assassin, part of a scheme to end the current UK regime and revive the Cold War. The real assassin gets the call from the Theater of Life. Blissfully unaware, Wallace walks without fear into a complex web of intrigue involving defense ministers, call girls, and Russian hitmen. For Wallace, all the world's a stage, and he's amazed at the skill of the actors, including beautiful enigmatic Lori (Joanne Whalley) -- while Wallace's pursuers are mystified by their adversary's fearlessness in the face of threats, torture and bullets. Farrar got the idea for this comedy from a chance remark at a party: ""The inspiration came from a dinner party, when somebody told me about these strange live theater performances which were all the rage in England in the '80s. The idea was to telephone for instructions if you wanted to take part. My immediate reaction was, 'Wouldn't it be fabulous if somebody got the wrong number, and it all went hopelessly wrong?'""

Sinbad (voice of Brad Pitt) and his crews of pirate adventurers are hoping to retire to Fiji, and they discover a treasure that could make that possible -- the Book of Peace, which has kept the Twelve Cities in harmony for centuries. But Sinbad's plan to snatch the magic book is complicated when he learns it's on board a ship captained by his longtime friend Proteus (voice of Joseph Fiennes). While Sinbad still has his eye on the book, so does the mischievous goddess Eris (voice of Michelle Pfeifer), who sends a deadly sea monster into Sinbad's path to scuttle his plans. With the help of Proteus, Sinbad prevails over the beast, and determined Eris responds by snatching the book and framing Sinbad for the crime. Noble Proteus offers to step in for Sinbad and take his punishment, so now the adventurer has ten days to rescue the book from Eris or Proteus will pay with his life. While Sinbad is at first uncertain if he should take on such a dangerous assignment or simply high-tail it to Fiji, someone is on hand to persuade him -- Marina (voice of Catherine Zeta-Jones), Proteus' lovely but hard-headed fiancÃƒÂ©e, who has stowed away on Sinbad's ship.

Tom Hanks plays Joe Banks, a man who hates his job, thinks the overhead fluorescent lights are making him sick, and quakes at the presence of his boorish boss Frank Watori (Dan Hedaya). He is attracted to the office secretary DeDe (Meg Ryan) but is afraid to speak to her. Then his life changes when he visits Dr. Ellison (Robert Stack). Dr. Ellison tells Joe that he has something called ""a brain cloud"" that is rapidly spreading throughout his brain. He will feel great, but he'll be dead within five months. Instead of being depressed at this bleak prognosis, Joe suddenly feels free. He quits his job, asks DeDe out, and is contacted by a rich millionaire named Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges). Graynamore owns an island named Waponi Woo, whose natives need to be placated. The natives require a sacrifice to their island volcano, the Big Woo, so that the island won't sink beneath the Pacific. Graynamore offers unlimited wealth to Tom in exchange for Tom's becoming the object of human sacrifice. Joe has nothing to lose, so he accepts the offer. As he heads out to the island, Joe meets Graynamore's daughters -- Angelica, a Los Angeles socialite, and Patricia, Angelica's blonde half-sister (both roles played by Ryan).

There, Gwen comes face to face with a unique set of rules (like no cell phones) and rituals (like chanting) embraced by an assortment of fascinating fellow re-habbers: Eddie, Gerhardt, Oliver, Andrea, Roshanda, and Billie Jean. A jaded city girl to the core, Gwen is determined not to conform. Then she meets Counselor Cornell, who begins to break through her carefully constructed defenses and force her to take a closer look at who she really is.

But it's a suit that may be won even before it begins--based solely on the selection, manipulation and, ultimately, the attempted ""theft"" of the jury. Representing the widow is Wendall Rohr, a courtly Southern lawyer with a moral center and a heartfelt passion for the case he's presenting. His opponent is ostensibly the attorney representing the corporation. But in reality, defense counsel is only the front man for Rankin Fitch, a brilliant and ruthless jury consultant. At a high tech command center set up in an old French Quarter warehouse, Fitch and his team work on the surveillance and assessment of potential jurors. He will know everything about their lives, and strategically manipulate the jury selection process. The only acceptable result is the perfect jury to vote in favor of his client. Fitch and Rohr soon realize they're not the only ones out to win the jury. One of the jurors, Nick Easter, seems to have his own plan for swaying the panel. And a mysterious woman known only as Marlee contacts both Rohr and Fitch telling them the jury's for sale to either of them--and that the verdict won't come cheap. While the case is argued in court, a dangerous cat and mouse game begins to play out in New Orleans' French Quarter.

Small-town girl Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) dreams of making a name for herself as a singer and songwriter, so she moves to New York City in hopes of landing her big break. Needing to support herself until stardom rolls around, she takes a job as a barmaid at a new nightspot called Coyote Ugly, where the owner Lil (Maria Bello) and the staff of attractive young women dance on the bar, flirt with the mostly male clientele, sing along with the jukebox, and goad the customers into matching them shot for shot. Soon, local media pick up on the bar's success, turning the staff into unexpected celebrities, a situation that presents its own set of problems.

It's been a good few years since Earl and Burt saved the town of Perfection, Nevada from the strange pre-Cambrian predators, and these days Earl is doing his best to find success as an ostrich farmer. Trouble is, none of Earl's birds want to breed, and it looks as if the farm is about to go under. Just when it seems that things couldn't get any worse for this monster-slaying cowboy, a pair of visitors arrives with a rather unusual proposition. According to the strangers, the Graboids have recently resurfaced in Sonora, Mexico, and they're currently getting fat on a steady diet of frightened oil field workers. Local businessman Carlos Ortega is willing to pay $50,000 a head for each worm killed, but Earl isn't so sure he wants to put himself in harm's way like that again. Still, Earl knows that he's the right man for the job, and after a bit of goading from ambitious cabbie Grady Hoover (Christopher Gartin) the pair are loading up their weapons and heading for the border. Upon arriving in Sonora, Earl quickly warms up to beautiful geologist Kate White (Helen Shaver), but the Graboid population has grown faster than suspected so in order to be successful this group will need the kind of firepower that only Burt Gummer can supply. Ever since Burt's wife walked out on him and the threat of World War III went away, the lonely survivalist has lost all direction in life. This is Burt's chance to prove that he's not just a useless middle aged man. But what the humans have failed to realize is that the Graboids have evolved to become deadlier than ever before, and they're not staying underground anymore.;S.S. Wilson;S.S.

Snow Dogs stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as Ted Brooks, a Florida-dwelling dentist with a successful chain of offices and a comfy, poolside lifestyle. All this changes, however, when he finds out that he was actually adopted as a child, and that his birth mother has died and left him an inheritance in her home state of Alaska, of all places. After arriving in the snow-bound clime, Ted learns that he has been willed a pack of cutely named sled dogs: Demon, Diesel, Dutchess, Nana, Mack, Scooper, Sniff, and Yodel. Problem is, the town's premiere sled-dogger, Thunder Jack (James Coburn), wants the pack for himself, and encourages Ted to go back to his tropical environs. But with a major sled-dog race looming, Ted's inspired to learn the ropes, as it were, and prove himself worthy of his birth mother's inheritance -- any way he can.

The condolences of friends and relatives don't help much when everything in the apartment they shared reminds her of him. She's a real basket case, and can barely get on with her life. One day, while plunking dejectedly on the piano, Nina looks up to discover Jamie, in ghostly form, lively as ever and just as loving. With a few new wrinkles (such as parties which include Jamie's newfound ghost friends), they resume living their relationship almost as before. Nina's friends are puzzled at her change from suicidal despondency to giddy cheefulness, but Jamie has pledged Nina to secrecy about their renewed relationship. For that reason, she cannot find any good excuses for not responding to the romantic advances of a living man, Mark (Michael Maloney).

When the United States sends its first manned mission to Mars, hopes are high for new scientific discoveries, but many of those hopes are dashed when the Mars crew meets an unexplained disaster; three members of the mission are killed, and a fourth (Don Cheadle) loses all radio contact with the Earth. A rescue mission sets out to bring back the one survivor; in the process, they discover that Mars may not be a dead planet after all, and uncover some startling evidence about the fate of their predecessors. The rescue crew includes Gary Sinise, Jerry O'Connell, Connie Nielsen and Tim Robbins.

While Liu Kang (Robin Shou) led his warriors Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess), Rayden (James Remar), and Johnny Cage (Chris Conrad) to victory, and the safety of the world seemed certain, no one counted on the treachery of Shao-Kahn (Brian Thompson), the evil Emperor of the Outerworld, who has a new plan to overtake the Earth. Shao-Kahn has discovered a portal between Earth and Outerworld, and if it stays open for seven days, the two worlds will merge, with Shao-Kahn controlling both planets. Rayden and Sonya set out to find his colleague Jax (Lynn Red Williams), while Liu Kang and Kitana are on the trail of Nightwolf (Litefoot) as they race against time to defeat Shao-Kahn, who has brought Kitana's mother Queen Sindel (Musetta Vander) back from the grave to aid his evil scheme.

This time, S.P.E.C.T.R.E. hijacks a NATO nuclear bomber, hiding the bombs under the ocean depths and threatening to detonate the weapons unless a ransom of 100,000,000 pounds is paid. The mastermind behind this scheme is international business executive Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), who maintains a pool full of sharks for the purpose of eliminating enemies and those henchmen who fail to come up to standard. Dispatched to the Bahamas, lucky Mr. Bond enjoys the attentions of three nubile ladies: Largo's mistress Domino Derval (Claudine Auger), British spy Paula Caplan (Martine Beswick, previously seen as a gypsy girl in the 1962 Bond epic From Russia With Love) and enemy agent Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi).;Terence Young;Richard Maibaum,John R.

Heinrich Himmler (Donald Pleasence), under orders from Hitler, assigns Nazi colonel Max Radl (Robert Duvall) the chore of sneaking the English-hating Irishman Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland) into the British countryside and arranging for a 16-man task force to be parachuted into the English country town of Sudley Constable, under the auspices of Colonel Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine).

After losing a rigged competition for admission into a prestigious music school, Xaio Chun is taken as a student by a brilliant but distracted teacher, Jiang (Wang Zhiwen), and begins to become distracted himself by his twenty-something party-girl neighbor Lili (Chen Hong). He eventually leaves Jiang for more rigorous study under a more famous teacher, Professor Yu (played by director Chen himself), which leaves him torn between his burgeoning career and the loving father who has sacrificed so much for his benefit.

William Holden plays Hal Carter, a handsome drifter who ambles into a small Kansas town during the Labor Day celebration to look up old college chum Alan (Cliff Robertson, in his film debut). Hoping to hit up Alan for a job--or a handout--Hal ends up stealing his buddy's fiancee Madge Owens (Kim Novak). Hal also has a catnip effect on spinster schoolteacher Rosemary Sydney (Rosalind Russell), so much so that Rosemary makes a fool of herself in front of the whole town, nearly driving away her longtime beau Howard Bevans (Arthur O'Connell). Persuaded by his friends and family that Hal is no damn good, Madge is prepared to break off her relationship. As anyone who remembers the film's famous overhead closing shot knows, however, Madge is ultimately ruled by her heart and not her head. For a film set in Kansas, there's an awful lot of New York talent in the supporting cast (Susan Strasberg and Phyllis Newman come immediately to mind); still, the Midwestern ambience comes through loud and clear, especially during the perceptively detailed Labor Day picnic sequence. Broadening the film's appeal is its George Duning-Steve Allen title song, a variation of the old standard ""Moonglow"". Two sidebars: The original Broadway production of Picnic starred Ralph Meeker and Paul Newman; for the film version of Picnic, William Holden was obliged to shave his chest, lest his hairy torso cause the female moviegoers to conjure up impure thoughts.";Joshua Logan;Daniel Taradash;/celebrity/daniel_taradash;as Hal Carter,as Madge Owens,as Rosemary Sidney,as Flo Owens,as Millie Owens,as Howard Bevans,as Alan,as Linda Sue Breckenridge,as Helen Potts,as Bomber,as Mr. Benson,as Christine Schoenwalder,as Juanita Badger,as Policeman,as Policeman,as Chamber of Commerce President,as Chamber of Commerce Man,as Chamber of Commerce Man,as Chamber of Commerce Man,as Chamber of Commerce Man,as Chamber of Commerce Man,as Trainman,as Foreman,as Stranger,as Grain Elevator Worker,as Mayor,as Committee Woman,as Neighbor;Picnic;https://resizing.flixster.com/cwFD2kKVIDaSUUcLIvLYKUKR7Kg=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDM4NDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTY1MDsyMjAw

Fortunately the KGB men are as burnt out as Gant, enabling him to abscond with the plane with the greatest of ease. The rest of the film is a protracted chase, pitting Gant against scores of impersonal MIG pilots.

Born and raised in a working-class Connecticut community, Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) made it into an Ivy League college, where he's done quite well; his dream is to be accepted into Harvard Law School, but he knows that it will take more than a good report card to beat out the competition. When an upper-crust secret society called the Skulls asks Luke to join, he eagerly accepts, thinking that the club's connections will help him gain acceptance to Harvard. He enjoys the Skulls' luxurious lifestyle, but when his roommate, a journalism student, dies of an apparent suicide, he's convinced that something is wrong. The deeper Luke digs into the secrets of the Skulls, the more he's convinced that his friend's death was no suicide and that he's put himself in more danger than he imagined. The Skulls was the first starring vehicle for Joshua Jackson, who gained fame on the TV series Dawson's Creek; the supporting cast includes Paul Walker, Craig T. Nelson, Hill Harper, and William L.

Betty Mahmoody (Sally Field) is reluctant to visit the wartorn homeland of her doctor husband, Moody (Alfred Molina). But, depressed about the racism of the American medical establishment and pining for contact with his family, Moody convinces her to join him for a two-week jaunt. The Islamic fundamentalism and strange customs of Iran bewilder and frighten Betty and her daughter, Mahtob (Sheila Rosenthal). But nothing prepares her for Moody's announcement that the family will be remaining in Tehran indefinitely. Despite beatings and more pervasive psychological control from her husband and his relatives, Betty makes it to the Swiss embassy (there is no American ambassador at the time). There, she learns that as the wife of an Iranian, she is now automatically considered a citizen and that she has absolutely no parental rights over Mahtob in this country. Betty then endures several years as a virtual prisoner, escaping only with the help of Westernized Iranian friends. Based on the book by the real-life Mahmoody and William Hoffer, Not Without My Daughter was coincidentally released during the long build-up to 1991's Gulf War.;Brian Gilbert;Pat Riddle,David W.

Jay Hernandez stars as Carlos Nunez, a poor but athletically gifted Latino teenager who endures a two-hour bus ride every day from East L.A. to attend the posh, wealthy Pacific Palisades High School in Los Angeles on a football scholarship. A straight-A student, Carlos is focused and driven, but his future is cast in doubt when he becomes the flirtation target of spoiled, self-destructive bad girl Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst), who's the daughter of a prominent congressman (Bruce Davison). When his friends, family, and even Nicole's own father oppose the romance for Carlos' sake, he chooses to ignore their advice and stubbornly pursues his relationship with Nicole, whose feelings grow from simple physical attraction to something much deeper.

Among his break-out buddies are the Anglin Brothers (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau), with whom he'd served in other lockups, and several others who've got their own special reasons to despise the sadistic McGoohan.

In the near future, a technology called ""quantum tunneling"" allows human beings to travel between parallel universes. The abuse of this ability by criminal elements has led to the formation of the Multi-Verse Authorities or ""MVA,"" an agency of quantum traveling cops who apprehend violators of inter-dimensional laws. The MVA faces its greatest crisis when a former agent named Gabriel Yulaw (Jet Li) goes renegade, traveling between one universe and the next, murdering his own parallel selves and gaining enormous power with each slaying. It is believed that when Yulaw has become ""the one,"" the only version of himself to exist, he will be omnipotent, but the final Gabriel Yulaw exists in our plane of existence (the ""magna universe"") and is also becoming stronger, though he doesn't understand why. Hot on the evil Yulaw's trail are his former partner Harry Roedecker (Delroy Lindo) and Harry's new colleague Evan Funsch (Jason Statham).

Dre (Taye Diggs) and Sidney (Sanaa Lathan) became best friends when they were ten years old -- the same time that both first became aware of the first rumblings of the Hip Hop revolution in New York City. Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend. While both have always denied their attraction to one another, Sidney begins to have second thoughts when Dre proposes to his girlfriend Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a lawyer. Even though Sidney has a relationship of her own with professional basketball player Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), as Dre's wedding draws closer, Sidney begins to suspect that her longtime best friend is actually the love of her life.

Profane, cocky, and arrogant, he's a great fighter pilot -- and he knows it. His boss hates his guts, but knows that if he's going to straighten out his lagging squadron, Meechum is the man to do it. The story and irony of The Great Santini is in Meechum's total intolerance of family life and fatherhood. Meechum has a lovely, supportive wife, Lillian (Blythe Danner), an earnest, likeable son, Ben (Michael O'Keefe), three smaller children, and a good home, but Meechum finds the pastoral nature of peacetime totally incompatible with his gung-ho nature. So he begins to drink. He drills his family unmercifully, like recruits. He hammers his son relentlessly until, in a basketball game, his son fights back, and the family cheers Ben's efforts. Tension builds in the household until, during one drunken night, Meechum breaks down. Based on a best-selling novel by Pat Conroy, The Great Santini earned critical raves but fared poorly at the box office.

In 1953, John Groberg (Christopher Gorham) is a 19-year-old student at Brigham Young University, whose greatest adventure in life had been to leave home to go to school in Utah. That all changes when Groberg accepts a missionary assignment in the Tonga Islands near Fiji; Groberg is instructed to ""build a kingdom"" and educate the natives about the Mormon faith, even though he knows little of their customs and nothing of their language. Leaving behind his sweetheart, Jean Sabin (Anne Hathaway), Groberg arrives in Tonga and is quickly immersed in the native culture, and strives to teach the Tongans about the teachings of the Latter-Day Saints while trying to respect their cultural traditions and face the joys and struggles of primitive life in the South Pacific alongside them. Groberg makes a valuable ally in Feki (Joe Folau), a Tongan who becomes an avid follower of the Mormon faith, but he also finds his loyalty to Jean (with whom he's been maintaining a long-distance relationship through cards and letters) tested when a native girl makes her attraction to him quite clear. Based on the real John Groberg's memoir In the Eye of the Storm, The Other Side of Heaven was produced by Jerry Molen, Academy Award winning producer of Schindler's List and Jurassic Park; it also marked the directorial debut of screenwriter Mitch Davis.";Mitch Davis;Mitch Davis;/celebrity/mitch_davis;as John Groberg,as Jean Sabin,as Feki,as Feki,as Kelepi,as Lavinia,as Tomasi,as Asi,as Kuli,as Kuli,as Noli;The Other Side of Heaven;https://resizing.flixster.com/LScmgd28dIaZlI1YA-9UexvVIPk=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNTA5NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), and Tank Sullivan (James Garner) were top pilots within an elite Air Force squadron and on the fast track to becoming the first Americans in space in the early 1950s. However, when NASA was established, the pilots were cut out of the loop; Corvin went on to become an aerospace engineer, Hawkins continued on as a freelance pilot, O'Neill became an astrophysicist with a sideline in designing roller coasters, and Sullivan took up preaching as a Baptist minister. Years later, a Russian satellite's guidance system has started to malfunction, and it is expected to crash into the Earth within a matter of weeks. The system is identical to the one Corvin designed for Skylab, so NASA head Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) asks Corvin to help him with the emergency mission to repair the satellite. Corvin agrees under one condition -- that he be sent up to do the repairs himself, with Hawkins, O'Neill, and Sullivan as his crew. Clint Eastwood directed Space Cowboys while also starring as Frank Corvin; his supporting cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, Courtney B.

And the sanitation gig is just the most recent of Joe's many incarnations during a tumultuous life, which got off on the wrong foot when Joe was abandoned at the Grand Canyon by his parents as a young child. After stumbling into the on-air studio, Joe steadily recounts the sad and comical story of how he cared for himself and journeyed around the country trying to relocate his family, all while being prodded, teased, and eventually embraced by a sarcastic deejay (Dennis Miller) and a rapt listening audience. His travels involve stints selling fireworks, wrangling alligators, riding aloft in a car dealership display balloon, and being held captive by a Silence of the Lambs-style serial killer. Despite numerous setbacks and bruising physical injuries, Joe emerges from each episode with his spirit intact as he searches optimistically for his roots, and eventually for the chance to return to the one place he was accepted -- a rural farm where the girl of his dreams (Brittany Daniel) awaits. The directorial debut of Dennie Gordon, Joe Dirt was produced by Adam Sandler's production company, Happy Madison, and features musician Kid Rock, also debuting, in the supporting role of Joe's rival. ~ Derek Armstrong, Rovi";Dennie Gordon;David Spade,Fred Wolf (II);/celebrity/david_spade,/celebrity/1095091-fred_wolf;as Joe Dirt,as Brandy,as Zander Kelly,as Kicking Wing,as Clem,as Jill,as Robby,as Joe Dirt (age 8),as Joe's Little Sister,as Joe's Mom,as Joe's Dad,as Charlene,as Greasy Mechanic,,as Producer Fred,as Meteor Bert,as Bondi,as Oil Rig Boss,as Oil Rig Co-Worker,as Buffalo Bob,as Man at Dental Clinic,as Zeke,as Security Guard,as Bullying Man No. 1,as Bullying Man No. 2,as Beauty College Woman,as Beauty College Woman,as Beauty College Woman,as Beauty College Woman,as Heckling Railroad Boy,as Heckling Railroad Boy,as Heckling Railroad Boy,as Painter,as Painter,as Painter,as Dude,as Woman With Roadrunner,as Bomb Squad Cop,as Sorority Girl,as Sorority Girl,as Sorority Girl,as Kid at Carnival,as Cop at Crime Scene,as Miss Clipper,as Cafeteria Kid,as Cafeteria Kid,as Cafeteria Kid,as Cafeteria Kid,as Cafeteria Kid,as Cafeteria Kid,as Chemistry Student,as Chemistry Teacher,as Hood,as Cop at Clem's House,as Car Dealer,as Old Cajun Man,as Newscaster,as Himself,as Joe's Fan,as Reporter at Parents' House,as Reporter on the Bridge,as Cop at Bridge,as Cop at Bridge,as Woman on Bridge;Joe Dirt;https://resizing.flixster.com/XmKEZRHjxj-TIUsD4j2hgVKrP4s=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2OTg3MTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Ted (Tim Roth) is the new bellboy at a beautiful but decaying luxury hotel; he is not having a good time of it on New Year's Eve, his first night on the job. In one room, a coven of witches are trying to summon the spirit of the goddess Diana; each of the witches must bring a different bodily fluid for their spell to work, but Eva (Ione Skye), who was supposed to bring semen, managed to lose her supplies, and needs Ted's help for a last-minute replacement. Another room, where Ted was supposed to deliver some ice, turns out to house an angry husband (David Proval), who is holding his bound-and-gagged wife (Jennifer Beals) at gunpoint. A third room is taken by a tough-talking gangster (Antonio Banderas), his doormat wife (Tamlyn Tomita), and their two children; the gangster demands that Ted watch over the kids, who turn out to be mischievous terrors beyond Ted's wildest imagination. And room number four is where an arrogant film actor (Quentin Tarantino) is holding a party. One of his guests makes a bet that he can get a Zippo lighter to light ten times in a row, with his finger at stake if he loses.

Brendan Fraser stars as David Greene, a working-class Jewish quarterback from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who is offered a senior year scholarship to a prestigious New England academy. It's David's ticket to an Ivy League education and a way out of his Rust Belt hometown, but there's one condition: the school's elders ask him to be discreet about his religion. At first willing to do so, David struggles with his silence about his faith as his popularity grows. David strikes up a friendship with his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and a possible romance with Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), a student at a nearby girls' school. When jealous classmate Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon) learns David's secret at an alumni party, he exposes the school's new gridiron hero, and David faces the full force of religious intolerance from the prejudiced WASP institution. Also featuring early performances from Ben Affleck, Anthony Rapp, and Cole Hauser, School Ties was loosely based on the real-life experiences of producer Dick Wolf, creator of TV's popular series Law & Order. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;Robert Mandel;Dick Wolf,Darryl Ponicsan,Norman Steinberg;/celebrity/dick_wolf,/celebrity/darryl_ponicsan,/celebrity/norman_steinberg_6;as David Greene,as Charlie Dillon,as Chris Reece,as Rip Van Kelt,as 'Mack' McGivern,as Jack Connors,as Sally Wheeler,as Mr. Cleary,as Chesty Smith,as Richard 'McGoo' Collins,as Headmaster Dr. Bartram,as Coach McDevitt,as Mr. Gierasch,as Allan Greene,,as Chaplain,as Grayson Dillon,as Jane Dillon,as Gray Dillon,as Bear,as Bear,as Nick,,as Kocus,as Weezer,as Mr. Wheeler,as Mrs. Wheeler,as Tom Keating,as Sarah,as Petey,as Miller,as Keller,as Rick,as Emile,as Jack,as Donald,as 1st Boy,as 2nd Boy,as Swanson,as Winchester Headmaster,as Mary Ellen,as Joyce,as Don,as Edie,as Cal Reynolds,as Chaperone,as Boy in Shower,as Boy #1,as Swimming Coach,as Boy in Dining Room,as Annoucer;School Ties;https://resizing.flixster.com/1snRIesT9Lr7et6sXA-i1eb6UN0=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MzY4NTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

After a brief prologue depicting the murder of Ocho's policeman father, it is revealed that she has grown up to become a professional gambler. Sex & Fury chronicles Ocho's exploits as she searches for her father's killers, each identified by unique tattoos on their backs (a deer, a boar, and a butterfly). Along the way, she also crosses paths with Shonusuke (Masataka Naruse), a radical set on murdering prominent politician Kurokawa (Seizaburo Kawazu) and Christina (Christina Lindberg), an American spy posing as a gambler. The various storylines frequently intersect, prompting a dizzying array of plot twists, overheated sex scenes, and gory swordplay. The pulp-heavy storyline is skillfully directed by Norifumi Suzuki, a veteran director of commercial Japanese fare who pumped up such sexy, violent spectacles with surrealistic visual flourishes and stylized sets and costumes. Sex & Fury was followed by Female Yakuza Tale: Inquisition and Torture, a sequel helmed by another Japanese exploitation film legend, Teruo Ishii. ~ Donald Guarisco, Rovi;Norifumi Suzuki;;;as Inoshika Ocho,as Christina,as Shonosuke,as Kurokawa,as Iwakura,,,,,,,,,;Sex & Fury;https://resizing.flixster.com/e-JivQgpHVcpXFEZTioPd9pXILI=/206x305/v1.bTsyNjc5MjE7ajsxNzQ2MzsxMjAwOzM1OTs1MDA

As a result, everyone in the film looks as though he or she is prepared to slit the throat of anyone who looks at them cross-eyed. Nigel Terry stars as the idealistic King Arthur, whose establishment of the idyllic Camelot does not take into account the fact that others are not as noble or altruistic as he is. The fly in the ointment is the covetous Morgana (Helen Mirren), who sets the wheels of Camelot's destruction in motion by bringing Arthur's attention to the love affair between Queen Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) and Sir Lancelot (Nicholas Clay). Props essential to the action are the elusive Holy Grail, and of course, the magical Excalibur sword. Far removed from the prettiness of the musical Camelot, Excalibur is set amidst the mud and maggots of Boorman's grim (and occasionally erotic) vision of pre-Norman England. Thomas Malory's Morte D'Arthur is listed as the source material for Excalibur, but, as is customary with Boorman, there is plenty of embroidering on the original.;John Boorman;Rospo Pallenberg,John Boorman;/celebrity/rospo_pallenberg,/celebrity/john_boorman;as King Arthur,as Guenevere,as Lancelot,as Merlin,as Leondegrance,as Morgana,as Uther,as Perceval,as Mordred,as Gawain,as Cornwall,as Uryens,as Igrayne,as Kay,as Sir Hector,as Lot,as Sadok,as Lot,as Astamor,as Boy Mordred,as Mordred's Lieutenant,as Mador,as Ulfus,as Abbot,as Young Morgana,as Lady in Waiting,as Young Morgana,as Aged Morgana,as Abbot;Excalibur;https://resizing.flixster.com/fiJGeRPaqPSEANRKKJKKq3Azd-E=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM5MDtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTgwMDsyNDAw

But the work keeps getting riskier, and at the urging of his girlfriend, Banks has decided to pull one final job, going in with some men who are planning a 20-million-dollar casino robbery in Las Vegas. Banks is double-crossed by his new partners, and while he gets away with the money, Banks also ends up behind bars. Now his fellow crooks want the cash and will do anything to get it, but Banks isn't eager to part with a hard-earned dollar, and with the help of Ice Cool (Anthony Criss, aka hip-hop star Treach), he busts out of prison to claim what's his.

In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Gladiator also features Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, and Oliver Reed, who died of a heart attack midway through production. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi;Ridley Scott;David H.

Glam rock star Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who does a character named Maxwell Demon, predicts his own death onstage. As per his prediction, this happens, but when the killing is exposed as a hoax, it marks the end of Slade's stardom. A decade later, in 1984, Brit reporter and former Slade fan Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), who witnesses the hoax murder, gets the assignment to do a ""Whatever Happened To..?"" article, and the film's plot suddenly goes into a prismatic Citizen Kane mode, reflecting various angles on Slade's life and career. Arthur visits the wheelchair-bound Cecil (Michael Feast), who discovered Slade, and then tracks Slade through his early life and his initial encounter with outrageous, maniacal American singer Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor). Slade's rise begins as manager Jerry Divine (Brit comedian Eddie Izzard) moves in to take over the performer's career. Ex-wife Mandy Slade (Toni Collette), interviewed by Arthur in a dimly lit nightclub, has memories going back to their initial 1969 Sombrero Club encounter. Their marriage paralleled his Bowie-like ascent to fame as an innovative, bisexual rock star pushing the limits. Idolized by teens, Slade teamed up for a while with the drug-addicted Wild. Eventually, the marriage of Mandy and Slade comes to an end, and she hasn't seen him in seven years when she's interviewed by Arthur. The soundtrack features vintage music by Bryan Ferry, Lou Reed and Brian Eno, plus new tunes. Some background on the making of Velvet Goldmine is documented in producer Christine Vachon's book Shooting to Kill: How an Independent Producer Blasts Through the Barriers to Make Movies That Matter (Avon, 1998) by Vachon with Slate film critic David Edelstein. ~ Bhob Stewart, Rovi";Todd Haynes;Todd Haynes;/celebrity/todd_haynes;as Curt Wild,as Arthur Stuart,as Mandy Slade,as Jerry Divine,as Shannon,as Cecil,as Female Narrator,as Wilde Housemaid,as Oscar Wilde (age 8),as Jack Fairy (age 7),as Jack Fairy,as BBC Reporter,as Kissing Sailor,as Brian Slade,as Young Man,as Lou,as Mary,as Murray,as Tommy Stone,as Girl on the Subway,as Mr. Stuart,as Mrs. Stuart,as Manchester Teacher,as Arthur's Teacher,as Boy in Record Shop 1,as Boy in Record Shop 2,as Brian Slade (age 7),as Pantomime Dame,as Pianist,as Mod Girlfriend,as Mimosa,as Curt Wild (age 13),as Bartender,as Cooper,as Angel,as Freddi,as Micky,as Cecil's Friend 1,as Cecil's Friend 2,as Rodney,as Middle Age Man,as 30's Style Singer,as Reporter 1,as Reporter 2,as US Reporter 1,as US Reporter 2,as US Reporter 3,as Teenage Girl,as Malcolm,as Ray,as Pearl,as Billy,as Trevor,as Reg,as Harley,as Bass Guitar,as Lead Guitar,as Drummer,as Polly Small,as Lead Guitar,as Bass Guitar,as Drummer;Velvet Goldmine;https://resizing.flixster.com/oYR4wUD4MSQFB7zWBHcJmt2goSI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3NjE4NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Presented as a straightforward documentary, the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994, three students went into the Maryland back woods to do a film project on the Blair Witch incidents. These kids were never seen again, and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment, found in the woods a year later. The entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes. The Blair Witch incident, as we initially learn from the local town elders, is an old legend about a group of witches who tortured and killed several children many years ago. Everyone in town knows the story and they're all sketchy on the details. Out in the woods and away from their parked car (and civilization), what starts as a school exercise turns into a nightmare when the three kids lose their map. Forced to spend extra days finding their way out, the kids then start to hear horrific sounds outside their tents in the pitch-black middle of night. They also find strange artifacts from (what can only be) the Blair Witch, still living in the woods. Frightened, they desperately try to find their way out of the woods, with no luck. Slowly these students start to unravel, knowing they have no way of getting out, no food, and it's getting cold.

Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), move into the Bramford, an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and only elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets' circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her. Polanski's camerawork and Richard Sylbert's production design transform the realistic setting (shot on-location in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building) into a sinister projection of Rosemary's fears, chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewer's imagination. This apocalyptic yet darkly comic paranoia about the hallowed institution of childbirth touched a nerve with late-'60s audiences feeling uneasy about traditional norms. Produced by B-horror maestro William Castle, Rosemary's Baby became a critically praised hit, winning Gordon an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Inspiring a wave of satanic horror from The Exorcist (1973) to The Omen (1976), Rosemary's Baby helped usher in the genre's modern era by combining a supernatural story with Alfred Hitchcock's propensity for finding normality horrific. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi";Roman Polanski;Roman Polanski;/celebrity/roman_polanski;"as Rosemary Woodhouse,as Guy Woodhouse,as Minnie Castevet,as Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins,as Roman Castevet,as Dr. Sapirstein,as Laura-Louise,as Dr. Hill,as Terry Fionoffrio,as Elise Dunstan,as Joan Jellico,as Dr. Shand,as Mrs. Gilmore,as Tiger,as Grace Cardiff,as Guy's Agent,as Nurse,as Pregnant Woman,as Mrs. John F.

Jarvis observes Dani as she and her live-in lover alternately have sex and argue violently. He begins to have his own fantasies about Dani and is inspired to base one of his characters on her. The ambitious Dani finds out about his novel, then campaigns to win the lead in Scott's upcoming film.

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note-taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted.

Instead, Jonathan Mostow, the man behind Breakdown and U-571, has stepped in to fill the shoes left vacant by Cameron. In addition, the role of John Connor from the second film has been recast, with In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl taking over for Edward Furlong. Set ten years after the events of 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the film finds Connor living on the streets as a common laborer. Sarah Connor, his mother, has since died, and their efforts in the second film have not stopped the creation of SkyNet artificial intelligence network. As he will still become the leader of the human resistance, Connor is once again targeted by a Terminator sent from the future by SkyNet. This new Terminator, T-X (Kristanna Loken), is a female and is more powerful than any of her predecessors. To protect Connor, the human resistance sends a new T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back from the future. Also starring Claire Danes, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had its world premiere when it showed out of competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.;Jonathan Mostow;Michael Ferris,John Brancato,Tedi Sarafian;/celebrity/michael_ferris,/celebrity/john_brancato,/celebrity/tedi_sarafian;as Terminator,as John Connor,as Kate Brewster,as T-X,as Robert Brewster,as Scott Petersen,as Dr. Peter Silberman,as Betsy,as Chief Engineer,as Brewster's Aide,as Paramedic Stevens,as Rich Woman,as Cop - Westside Street,as Cop, Westside Street,as Roadhouse Bouncer,as Roadhouse Clubgoer No. 1,as Roadhouse Clubgoer No. 2,as Male Stripper,as Angry Man,as Bill Anderson,as Bill Anderson's Girlfriend,as KTLA Anchorman,as Jose Barrera,as Paramedic No. 1,as Paramedic Stevens,as Gas Station Cashier,as Detective Martinez,as Detective Edwards,as SWAT Team Leader,as Mr. Smith,as Mr. Jones,as Laura the CRS Tech,as 2nd Engineer,as 3rd Engineer,as Roadhouse Clubgoer No. 3,as CRS Victim,as CRS Executive,as Semi Truck Driver,as Mr. Jones;Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines;https://resizing.flixster.com/gRrrSzCtEeXcoEBU6FVIBStsD-s=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM3MztqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MjI1MDszMDAw

Set in the Bronx in 1963, the film concerns the titular gang of Italian-American teens and their ongoing power struggle with the rival ""Fordham Baldies."" Richard Price, upon whose novel this film was based, drew from his own experiences to weave his tale. Essentially a series of anecdotes-some tension-filled, some amusing -- The Wanderers climaxes on the occasion of the J.F.K. assassination, which for Price and hundreds and thousands of his aimless contemporaries served as a wake-up call. Viewed from the vantage point of the 1990s, one would wish that the current street gangs be shocked into adulthood with such suddenness (though not through the same tragic means). Ken Wahl, Karen Allen, and Linda Manz are among the standout performers in this richly detailed period piece. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi";Philip Kaufman;Philip Kaufman,Rose Kaufman;/celebrity/philip_kaufman,/celebrity/rose_kaufman_5;as Richie,as Joey,as Nina,as Despie Galasso,as Turkey,as Buddy,as Perry,as Peewee,as Emilio,as Terror,as Mr. Sharp,as Chubby Galasso,as Clinton,as Marine Recruiter,as Roger,as Teddy Wong,as Joey's Mom,,as Peppy Dio,as Terri Perri,as Bowling Bankroller,as Bowling Bankroller,as Buddy's Woman,as Del Bomber,as Del Bomber,as Referee,as Waitress,as Gloria Galasso,as Sportsman,as Wanderer,as Crying Woman,as Boo Boo,as Tony,as Bowler,as Folk Singer,as Pretty Girl,as Big Lady,as Dushie,as Georgie,as Despie's Girlfriend,as Mau Mau,as Ducky Boy,as Pharoah Leader,as Ducky Boy Leader,as Ducky Boy #2,as Ray Leader,as Executioner Leader;The Wanderers;https://resizing.flixster.com/stdcRuRR8jv-Su-vFzbIpdZDJt4=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM2OTtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MjA2NjszMDk5

Resting in the confines of a Mud Creek, TX, nursing home after fading into obscurity following his departure from the limelight, an aging and embittered Elvis (Bruce Campbell) befriends a delusional patient named Jack (Ossie Davis) who claims to be John F. Kennedy. It seems that at the height of his popularity Elvis had switched identities with a convincing double, and, upon the death of the substitute, missed his chance to reclaim his former fame. Despite his anger at never having made a comeback, Elvis finds a new reason to live when Jack tips him off to an evil mummy that is feasting on the souls of hapless nursing home inhabitants. Before long the geriatric duo must muster the strength to fend off the malevolent soul sucker lest they ultimately fall prey to the fearsome Bubba Ho-Tep (Bob Ivy).;Don Coscarelli;Don Coscarelli;/celebrity/don_coscarelli_2;as Elvis,as Jack Kennedy,as Mummy,as Rest Home Administrator,as Nurse,as Callie,as Kemosabe,as Trailer Trash,as Hearse Driver,as Hearse Driver,as Bull Thomas;Bubba Ho-Tep;https://resizing.flixster.com/YNNk8U0gjxNL7gHmgcah6o4zfFM=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM3MjtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Jason, the eighth entry in the Nightmare on Elm Street saga and the 11th film in the Friday the 13th series, though with Jason X taking place in the future, it should be noted that the events of this film take place after the ninth film Jason Goes to Hell. And it is hell where Freddy Kreuger (Robert Englund) and Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger, donning the hockey mask for the first time in a controversial snub against series veteran Kane Hodder) finally become acquainted. Banished there for eternity, Freddy devises a plan to manipulate Jason into continuing his work, hacking up the teenagers of Elm Street. All goes well at first until Jason realizes he's been duped by ""the dream master"" and is none too pleased. Coaxed by surviving teenagers Will (Jason Ritter), Lori (Monica Keena), and Kia (Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland), Jason and Freddy descend upon Crystal Lake for a mano a mano battle royal. Helmed by Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky, The Bride With the White Hair), Freddy Vs. Jason features the director of the first Friday film, Sean S.

Bruce Campbell returns as the one-armed Ash, now a supermarket employee (""Shop Smart...Shop S-Mart"") who is transported by the powers of a mysterious book back in time with his Oldsmobile '88 to the 14th century medieval era. Armed only with a shotgun, his high school chemistry textbook, and a chainsaw that mounts where his missing appendage once resided, the square-jawed, brutally competent Ash quickly establishes himself as a besieged kingdom's best hope against an ""army of darkness"" currently plaguing the land. Since the skeleton warriors have been resurrected with the aid of the Necronomicon (the same tome that can send Ash back to his own time) he agrees to face the enemy in battle. Ash also finds romance of a sort along the way with a beautiful damsel in distress, Sheila (Embeth Davidtz), and contends with his own doppelganger after mangling an important incantation. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Sam Raimi;Sam Raimi,Ivan Raimi;/celebrity/sam_raimi,/celebrity/ivan_raimi;as Ash,as Sheila,as Arthur,as Wiseman,as Duke,as Gold Tooth,as Girlfriend,as Blacksmith,as Cowardly Warrior,as 1st Tiny Ash,as 2nd Tiny Ash,,as Old Woman,as 1st Pit Deadite,as 2nd Pit Deadite,as Winged Deadite,as Fake Shemp,as Deadite Captain,as Fake Shemp,as Fake Shemp,as Henry's Man,as Fake Shemp,as 1st Lieutenant,as 2nd Lieutenant,as Tower Guard,as Fake Shemp,as Chief Archer,as Fake Shemp,as Fake Shemp,as Possessed Witch/S-Mart Employee;Army of Darkness;https://resizing.flixster.com/HfdU4F9JF9wM4_1hxWE43FOtd8g=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2ODgwODtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Then they are informed that they are accused of murder. Penniless and without a single friend in the area, Bill decides to call his goofy cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), who has somehow recently become a lawyer. Full of family feeling and bravado, Vinny, who has never tried a criminal case in his short life as a lawyer, rides south to defend his trusting relative. He's an expert motormouth and street-level logician from the wilder reaches of metropolitan New York, complete with a thick accent and the attitude to go with it. Otherwise, he's much less well qualified than your average public defender. When he arrives on the scene with his equally brassy girlfriend Lisa (Marisa Tomei), Bill is fairly sure he's going to be sentenced to death. His buddy Stan is even less confident of his legal representative, if that's possible, and the first thing Vinny has to do is to regain the consent of his clients to represent them. The local judge doesn't seem any too sympathetic to Vinny's verbal shenanigans either, and even the most optimistic supporter of the boys would begin to have doubts at this point -- and Vinny's no exception. With the insistent moral encouragement of his girlfriend, Vinny somehow accomplishes the impossible and wins grudging (if very irritated) respect from all concerned, for once studying as if his life depended on it. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi;Jonathan Lynn;Dale Launer;/celebrity/dale_launer;as Vinny Gambini,as Bill Gambini,as Mona Lisa Vito,as Stan Rothenstein,as Judge Chamberlain Haller,as Jim Trotter III,as John Gibbons,as Sheriff Farley,as Sam Tipton,as Constance Riley,as Ernie Crane,as George Wilbur,as J.T.,as Neckbrace,as Grits Cook,as Jimmy Willis,as Jimmy Willis,as Man in Town Square,as 1st Guard,as 2nd Guard,as 1st Deputy,as 2nd Deputy,as 3rd Deputy,as Hotel Clerk,as Woman,as Prison Van Driver,as Bailiff,as Courtroom Clerk,as 1st Juror,as Courtroom Clerk,as 2nd Juror;My Cousin Vinny;https://resizing.flixster.com/aki9NhOyNEGUr1o8uejiXZgz6Mw=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM3MTtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTUwMDsyMDAw

Connie (Lane) leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward (Gere), her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator (Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos) to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him. While the screenplay for Unfaithful is credited to Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) and William Broyles Jr. (Cast Away), the inspiration for Lyne's film came from Claude Chabrol's acclaimed 1969 film La Femme Infidele. ~ Josh Ralske, Rovi;Adrian Lyne;Alvin Sargent,William Broyles;/celebrity/alvin_sargent,/celebrity/william_broyles;as Connie Sumner,as Edward Sumner,as Paul Martel,as Charlie,as Gloria,as Lindsay,as Bill Stone,as Conductor,as Bob Gaylord,as Other Businessman,as Tracy,as Sally,as Cafe Bartender,as Frank Wilson,as Tim,as Businessman No. 1,as Businessman No. 2,as Businessman No. 3,as Businessman No. 4,as Grumpy Teacher,as Parking Lot Attendant,as Other Woman,as Man with Suitcase,as Passerby,as Crying Boy,as Father of Crying Boy,as Detective Dean,as Detective Mirojnick,as Grandma,as Aunt Rikke,as Uncle Russell,as Aunt Maria,as Uncle Les,as Dry Cleaner,as Beth,as Jeff,as Auctioneer,as Cop Outside Auction;Unfaithful;https://resizing.flixster.com/8H4nBA6MK9YmEhmBKpYQn8M9a-Q=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM2NztqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTIwMzsxNjA0

Their personalities and motivations are varying: Sara (Bianca Kajlich) is a shy psychology major; Jen (Katee Sackhoff) hopes to launch a broadcasting career; Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas) is a culinary arts student; Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a womanizing law student; Jim (Luke Kirby) is a rebellious musician; and Donna (Daisy McCrackin) is a brainy skeptic. Believing that the night is nothing more than a stunt that will provide them with scholarship money, the ill-advised participants are soon shuffling off their mortal coils thanks to Michael's typically ghoulish but creative methods of homicide. In the meantime, Michael's sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), is a suicidal mute, incarcerated and hospitalized for the murder of an innocent man she wrongly believed was her brother three years earlier, but a confrontation between the combative siblings is brewing.

Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) is a medical student who is heading home after a long day of school and work when he unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of what appears to be a rumble between two well turned-out street gangs. What Michael doesn't know is he has witnessed a skirmish between two deadly underground communities, unknown to the mortal world, who are battling for supremacy -- the Death Dealers, a tribe of vampires, and the Lycans, a band of werewolves. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a leading member of the Death Dealers who hears through the grapevine that the Lycans have plans to capture the aspiring doctor who witnessed their battle. Certain something is in the air, Selene begins following Michael around the city, and she finds herself growing emotionally attached to him. As Selene becomes more attracted to Michael, she becomes more convinced that the Lycans are planning a major attack against the Death Dealers, although vampire kingpin Kraven (Shane Brolly) is certain she's crediting the Lycans with more intelligence than they can muster. As Selene shadows Michael, she finds herself wanting to protect him, but her longing becomes a handicap when he's attacked by Lucian (Michael Sheen), the leader of the werewolf community, and the man she wants to save has now become a sworn enemy.

Mayer and Harry Cohn). Despising the film capital and everything it stands for, Barton Fink comes down with an acute case of writer's block. He is looked after by a secretary (Judy Davis) who has been acting as a ghost writer for an alcoholic screenwriter (John Mahoney, playing a character based on William Faulkner). Also keeping tabs on Fink is a garrulous traveling salesman (John Goodman), the most likeable, stable character in the picture. And then comes the plot twist to end all plot twists, plunging Barton Fink into a surreal nightmare that would make Hieronymus Bosch look like a house painter. Once more, Ethan and Joel Coen serve up a smorgasbord of quirkiness and kinkiness, where nothing is what it seems and nothing turns out as planned. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi;Joel Coen;Joel Coen,Ethan Coen;/celebrity/joel_coen,/celebrity/ethan_coen;as Barton Fink,as Charlie Meadows,as Audrey,as Lipnick,as Mayhew,as Geisler,as Lou,as Chet,as Garland Stanford,as Detective Mastrionotti,as Detective Deutsch,,as Derek,,as Poppy Carnahan,as Richard St. Claire,as Pete,as Maitre d',as Stagehand,as Clapper Boy,as Referee,as Wrestler,as Geisler's Secretary,as Sailor,as USO Girl,as Beauty,as Voice of Stage Actress,,as Page Calling for Barton Fink;Barton Fink;https://resizing.flixster.com/24KVMKfosljAXwoF_N4RzNL_feQ=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM1NztqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTIwMDsxNjAw

Travolta plays Tony Manero, a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life, Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor, he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another (including ""Stayin' Alive""), we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty, undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner, Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney), a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978, when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time, it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come, as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970s disco culture. Two versions of this film exist: the original R-rated version and a PG version, edited down to more ""family-friendly"" fare and fed to the public with the tagline, ""Because we want everyone to see John Travolta's performance."" ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi";John Badham,Randal Kleiser;Norman Wexler;/celebrity/norman_wexler;as Tony Manero,as Stephanie,as Annette,as Bobby,as Joey,as Double J,as Gus,as Flo,as Frank,as Fusco,as Grandmother,as Linda,as Doreen,as Pete,as Paint Store Customer,as Becker,as Girl in Disco,,as Connie,as Deejay,as Jay Langhart,as Haberdashery Salesman,as Detective,as Pizza Girl,as Deejay,as Frank Sr.,as Bartender,as Woman in Paint Store,as Bartender;Saturday Night Fever;https://resizing.flixster.com/CCDCtySJaFWfImJ4MT0F3RHk4YE=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTM3MjM1NDtqOzE3NTQ2OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Baldwin is transferred to a ""safe"" assignment, assisting arson investigator Robert DeNiro, who is trying to make sense of a series of fires involving an oxygen-induced ball of fire called a backdraft. The investigation reveals a link between corrupt alderman J. T. Walsh and imprisoned pyromaniac Donald Sutherland.

Fiercely protected by Aurora throughout childhood, Emma runs into resistance from her mother when she marries wishy-washy college teacher Flap (Jeff Daniels). Aurora is even more put out at the prospect of being a grandmother, though she grows a lot fonder of her three grand-kids than she does of her son-in-law. Flap proves that Aurora's instincts were on target when he enters into an affair with a student (Kate Charleson). Meanwhile, Emma finds romantic consolation with an unhappily married banker (played by John Lithgow, who registers well in a rare ""nice guy"" performance). As for Aurora, she is ardently pursued by her next-door neighbor, boisterous astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). After 75 minutes or so of pursuing an episodic, semi-comic plot line, the film abruptly shifts moods when Emma discovers that she has terminal cancer. Terms of Endearment won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for TV veteran James L. Brooks making his first feature film, Best Actress for MacLaine, and Best Supporting Actor for Nicholson.

In 1916, Chicago steelworker Bill (Richard Gere, stepping in for John Travolta) flees to Texas with his little sister Linda (Linda Manz) and girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) after fatally erupting at his boss. Along with other itinerant laborers, they work the harvest at a wealthy, ailing farmer's ranch, but the farmer (playwright Sam Shepard) falls in love with Abby, and, believing her to be Bill's sister, asks the three to stay on at his elysian spread. Seeing it as his one real chance to escape perpetual poverty, Bill urges Abby to marry the sick man. Marriage, however, has more restorative powers, and the farmer has more magnetism, than Bill had planned. ""Nobody's perfect,"" Linda impassively observes in one of her many voiceovers, after their brief paradise is erased by plagues of locusts, fire, and lethal jealousy. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi";Terrence Malick;Terrence Malick;/celebrity/terrence_malick;as Bill,as Abby,as The Farmer,as Linda,as Farm Foreman,as Mill Foreman,as Harvest Hand,as Dancer,as Farm Foreman,as Linda's friend,as Harvest Hand,as Fiddler,as Vaudeville Leader,as Vaudeville Wrestler,as Vaudeville Dancer,as Accountant,as Preacher,as Headmistress,as Preacher,as Farm Worker;Days of Heaven;https://resizing.flixster.com/2EA8RAq5PHtrc-XTiwIVpZy8xFo=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE1Nzg3NTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7OTAwOzE0NDY

Allen plays Boris, a 19th century Russian who falls in love with his distant (and married) cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton). Pressed into service with the Russian army during the war against Napoleon, Boris accidentally becomes a hero, then goes on to win a duel against a cuckolded husband (Harold Gould). He returns to Sonja, hoping to settle down on the Steppes somewhere, but Sonja has become fired up with patriotic fervor, insisting that Boris join a plot to kill Napoleon. Intellectual in-jokes abound in Love and Death, and other gags are basic Allen one-liners; for instance, after being congratulated for his lovemaking skills, Boris replies nonchalantly, ""I practice a lot when I'm alone."" The pseudo-Russian ambience of Love and Death is comically enhanced by the Sergey Prokofiev compositions on the musical track. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi";Woody Allen;Woody Allen;/celebrity/woody_allen;as Boris,as Sonja,as Anton,as Mother,as Priest,as Old Nehamkin,as Drill Sergeant,as Mikhail,as Waiter,as Rimsky,as Don Francisco,as Gen.

The photography is suitably moody, and many of the standard haunted-house cliches are used to decent effect -- particularly a violent scene in which the surrounding woods form a barrier to prevent the family station wagon from escaping the area -- but the pace is too leisurely overall, climaxing with the type of grim ending employed by nearly every mainstream horror film in the late 70's.

Omri is the only one privy to the cupboard's secret, but he decides to share it with his best friend Patrick, who places a cowboy within it.

Though Nicholas is devoted to Alexandra, the Russian populace is less politely inclined to having a ""foreigner"" as their Czarina. Alexandra gains favor when she gives birth to the much-loved Prince Alexis (Roderick Noble). Alas, Alexis suffers from hemophilia, a disease which strikes every second generation of Alexandra's family. When all conventional medical ministrations fail, Alexandra puts the fate of her son in the hands of mystical holy man Rasputin (Tom Baker, later famous for his portrayal of Doctor Who). As Rasputin's influence and power grows, the Russian peasantry becomes more restless and disgruntled. They are now willing to listen to the speeches of such rabble-rousers as Lenin (Michael Bryant) and Trotsky (Brian Cox), who sow the seeds of revolution. Even after the murder of Rasputin, the Bolsheviks are unsatisfied: The revolution finally comes to pass in October of 1917. At first, the moderate Kerensky (John McEnery) pleads with his followers to allow the Romanovs safe passage out of Russia. But the radicals seize control, and on July 16, 1918, the royal family is summarily executed.";Franklin J.

When Johnson wakes up following the wreck, it is as a large brown dog. (From this point on, the film is shot from the dog's point of view) Fluke is then seen as a puppy torn from his mother and forced to endure different forms of cruelty from the people that own him. He is later adopted by a homeless woman and is happy, until she dies. He is then befriended by Rumbo, a street-smart stray who begins to teach Fluke the fundamentals of survival. Then Fluke loses Rumbo when the cur is shot. Fluke/Johnson begins to remember his human wife and gentle son; he decides he must find them and become a part of their lives. As he travels, he is also haunted by the fight with his partner that precipitated the race. When Fluke does finally arrive to his former home, he must really work to get his wife to accept a pet, and also he must work to bond with his son who still suffers terribly from the loss of his father.";Carlo Carlei;Carlo Carlei,James Carrington;/celebrity/carlo_carlei,/celebrity/james_carrington;as Fluke/Thomas Johnson,as Carol Johnson,as Jeff Newman,as Brian Johnson,as Sylvester,as Boss,as Bert,as Bella,as Professor Santini,as Tom's Secretary,as Night Guard,as Day Guard,as Dog Pound Vet,as Housekeeper,as Schoolboy,as Woman #1,as Woman #2,as Paramedic #1,as Paramedic #2,as News Stand Man,as Policeman #1,as Policeman #2,as Rose,as Farmer,as Skeptical Man,as Priest,as Asian Dishwasher,as Security Guard,as Delivery Boy,as Rumbo;Fluke;https://resizing.flixster.com/vrfYRlk3n-dDBoJYcoR7V3JVTPY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDM2NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTY1MDsyMjAw

Denzel Washington stars as John Q. Archibald, a factory worker facing financial hardship as a result of reduced hours in his workplace. When his young son, Michael (Daniel E. Smith), is stricken during a baseball game, John and his wife, Denise (Kimberly Elise), discover that their child is in need of an emergency heart transplant. Although the Archibalds have health insurance, they are informed by hospital administrator Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) that their policy doesn't cover such an expensive procedure. Unable to raise the money himself, John persuades the hospital's compassionate cardiac surgeon, Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods), to waive his lofty fee, but is still left with too much of a financial burden to bear. With no recourse but to take his son home to die, John snaps and holds the staff and patients of the hospital's emergency room hostage at gunpoint. John is soon a media hero, the focus of intense news coverage, even as police chief Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta) and hostage negotiator Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) try to resolve the situation before it leads to bloodshed. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;Nick Cassavetes;James Kearns;/celebrity/james_kearns;as John Quincy Archibald,as Lt.

In condensing Herbert's rambling and complex book by eliminating characters and compacting events, Lynch succeeds in rendering the story incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the novel and making the film look like a sketchy greatest hits collection of the book for Herbert fans. The story takes place in the year 10,191. The universe is governed through a system of feudal rule, presided over by Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (JosÃƒÂ© Ferrer), who appears to take his marching orders from something that resembles a talking vagina. In the kingdom are two rival houses -- the House of Atreides and the House of Harkonnen. Each house is trying to gain dominion over the universe, but that dominion can only be gained by the house that controls the Spice, a special substance that permits the folding of time. The Spice is only available on the desert world of Arrakis, or Dune. Shaddam, tired of the feuding between the two houses, permits the Atreides to take over the Spice production on Dune, while secretly working with the Harkonnens to launch a sneak attack on the Atreides and destroy them. The leader of the Atreides is Duke Leto (JÃƒÂ¼rgen Prochnow), who rules with the help of his concubine Jessica (Francesca Annis) and son Paul (Kyle MacLachlan). The rival Harkonnens are headed by the pus-oozing degenerate Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan, in a thoroughly through-the-roof performance) and his two unsavory nephews, Rabban (Paul L.

Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, an operative for the top-secret government agency IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Fellow agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) has gone rogue, stealing a sample of a deadly synthetic virus named Chimera that could rapidly wipe out the world's population. Ambrose's plan is to sell Chimera to the highest bidder in exchange for shares of stock in the winner's company. Summoned by the new IMF chief (Anthony Hopkins in an uncredited cameo role), Ethan is assigned to recruit the help of Ambrose's former lover Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a gorgeous woman who left Ambrose broken-hearted and who may be able to quickly regain his confidence. Once he meets and spends a night with Nyah, however, Ethan is smitten, and now must both capture Ambrose and keep Nyah alive as she infiltrates a nest of vipers. Sophisticated disguises, gun battles, and high-speed chases are the order of the day, very much in the James Bond mold. Mission: Impossible 2 is based on a story by Star Trek: The Next Generation writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, with a script polish by Robert Towne. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;John Woo;William Goldman,John Logan,David Marconi,Michael Tolkin,Robert Towne,Rick Berman;/celebrity/william_goldman,/celebrity/john_logan,/celebrity/david_marconi,/celebrity/michael_tolkin,/celebrity/robert_towne,/celebrity/rick_berman_6;as Ethan,as Sean,as Nyah,as Luther,as Hugh,as Billy,as John,as Dr. Nekhorvich,as Wallis,as Ulrich,as Michael,as McCloy's Accountant,as McCloy's Chemist,as Larrabee,as Biocyte Security Guard No. 2,as Relief Pilot,as Dr. Gradsky,as Biocyte Security Guard No. 1,as Bookie,as Prison Guard No. 2,as Mission Commander (uncredited),as Biocyte Security Guard No. 3,as Flamenco Dancer No. 1,as Flamenco Dancer No. 2,as Flamenco Dancer No. 3,as Flamenco Dancer No. 4,as Flamenco Dancer No. 5,as Flamenco Dancer No. 6,as Flamenco Dancer No. 7,as Co-Pilot,as Senor De L'Arena;Mission: Impossible 2;https://resizing.flixster.com/InMU5O5BXTxlJFVWozmWvMvwPCg=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDM2NDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7OTk5OzEzMzI

Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack came up with the 1949 special-effects smorgasbord Mighty Joe Young. Robert Armstrong reprises his Kong portrayal of Carl Denham as hot-shot showbiz entrepreneur Max O'Hara. While in Africa looking for authentic decorations for his new night club, O'Hara makes the acquaintance of Mr. Joseph Young, a ten-foot-tall ape. Unlike King Kong, Joe Young has a heart of gold, thanks in great part to his owner, a lovely lass named Jill Young (Terry Moore). Against her better judgment, Jill allows O'Hara to bring Joe back to the States as a nightclub attraction. Joe proves to be a smash as he participates in Jill's musical act (he lifts her grand piano while she plays ""Beautiful Dreamer"") and performs a tug-of-war routine with an imposing lineup of professional wrestlers (including Tor Johnson, Man Mountain Dean and Primo Carnera). But when the patrons go home each night, Joe is unhappily relegated to his cage. When a group of obnoxious drunks begin teasing Joe, the disgruntled ape breaks loose and goes on a rampage. Slated to be put to death, Joe redeems himself by rescuing a group of screaming children from an orphanage fire.

Woody Allen plays Allan Felix, a writer for Film Quarterly consumed by movies, particularly his favorite film of all time, Casablanca. At the start of the film, Allan's wife Nancy (Susan Anspach) has just left him and is applying for a divorce. Unable to deal with this emotional turmoil, Allan seeks solace in the movies he loves, imagining Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy) has dropped by his apartment to offer Allan advice on dealing with the ladies (""Dames are simple. I never met one that didn't understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a forty-five""). Helping Allan meet new women are his good friends Dick (Tony Roberts) and Linda Christie (Diane Keaton). Dick and Linda fix him up with a succession of dates, all of which end disastrously because of Allan's nervousness and insecurity. Finally, Allan realizes that he has been spending more time with Linda than anyone else and he is becoming attracted to her -- she's the only woman he truly feels comfortable around. Linda proves unexpectedly receptive to Allan's advances, since Dick's workaholic ways leave Linda neglected and ignored.";Herbert Ross;Woody Allen;/celebrity/woody_allen;as Allan,as Linda,as Dick,as Bogart,as Nancy Felix,as Sharon,as Julie,,as Jennifer,as Disco Girl,as Hood#1,as Hood#2,as Museum Girl,as Fantasy Girl;Play It Again, Sam;https://resizing.flixster.com/YOzF0jk0nfZn6kb1GRRhzPD96ho=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTI5MDI2NztqOzE3NTQ1OzEyMDA7MTgwMDsyNDAw

Is this a feasible feat for a man of the court? And what of the King? The men begin to pursue their desires unbeknownst to each other, acting in secret and concealing their passions. The mood is broken by the news of the death of the Princess's father and the girls return to France.

Thanks to a mix-up in transmutation, Tomlin winds up instead trapped in the body of upright (and uptight) attorney Steve Martin. The plot involves the fragility of male-female relationships, the importance of making commitments, and the antics of goofy guru Richard Libertini. As ridiculous as it sounds, All of Me is completely credible, thanks to Steve Martin's remarkable ""body language"" when conveying the notion that he's two different people with two different sets of emotions and gestures. Though the circumstances of the plot won't allow Martin to connect with the lovely Tennant, in real life things were different: the two costars were married shortly after filming wrapped.

Coal Miner's Daughter is a screen adaptation of Lynn's autobiography, starring Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. One of eight children born to Ted Webb (Levon Helm), a coal miner raising a family despite grinding poverty in Butcher's Holler, KY, Loretta married Dolittle ""Mooney"" Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones) when she was only 13 years old. A mother of four by the time she was 20, Lynn began singing the occasional song at local honky-tonks on weekends, and at 25, she cut (at Mooney's suggestion) a demo tape that earned her a deal with an independent record label. Loretta and Mooney's tireless promotion of the record (including a long road trip through the south in which they stopped at every country radio station they could find) paid off -- Loretta's first single, ""Honky Tonk Girl,"" hit the charts and earned her a spot on the Grand Ole Opry. Stardom called and Loretta never looked back, but success brought with it both joy (a long string of hit records and sold-out concerts and a close friendship with Patsy Cline) and sorrow (a nervous breakdown brought on by overwork and a great deal of stress to a marriage that endured -- but just barely). Sissy Spacek won an Academy award for her vivid, thoroughly natural performance as Loretta (she also did her own singing), and Levon Helm (drummer for the legendary rock group the Band) made an impressive screen debut as her father. Ernest Tubb makes a cameo appearance as himself. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Michael Apted;Tom Rickman,Thomas Rickman;/celebrity/tom_rickman,/celebrity/thomas_rickman;as Loretta Lynn,as Doolittle Lynn,as Patsy Cline,as Ted,as Clara,as Webb Child,as Webb Child,as Webb Child,as Webb Children,as Webb Child,as Webb Child,as Lee Dollarhide,as Loretta and Mooney's Child,as Loretta and Mooney's Child,as Loretta and Mooney's Child,as Loretta and Mooney's Child,as Bobby Day,as Charlie Dick,as Himself,as Doc Turner,as Patsy Lynn,as Peggy Lynn,as Storekeeper,as Girl at Fairgrounds,as Hugh Cherry,as Radio Station Manager,as Speedy West,as Opry Stage Manager,as Opry Announcer,as Washington Neighbor,as Cowboy at Tootsie's,as Redhead at Tootsie's,as Lizzie,as The Coal Miner's Band,as The Patsy Cline Band,as Preacher,as John Penn,,as Cowboy at Grange Hall,as Red Lynn,as Bidder at Pie Auction,as Teacher at Pie Auction,as Teacher at Pie Auction,as Teacher at Pie Auction,as Business Manager,as Woman With Doll,as Road Manager,as Bus Driver;Coal Miner's Daughter;https://resizing.flixster.com/2G22ALus201O29vEoFAmruIkIvI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3ODc3MztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTAwMDsxNTAw

Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a serious Christian Scotsman, believes that he has to succeed as a testament to his undying religious faith. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), is a Jewish Englishman who wants desperately to be accepted and prove to the world that Jews are not inferior. The film crosscuts between each man's life as he trains for the competition, fueled by these very different desires. As compelling as the racing scenes are, it's really the depth of the two main characters that touches the viewer, as they forcefully drive home the theme that victory attained through devotion, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice is the most admirable feat that one can achieve. (Ian Holm was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor in his role as Abrahams' coach), and this powerful film ended up with four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score. ~ Don Kaye, Rovi;Hugh Hudson;Colin Welland;/celebrity/colin_welland;as Harold Abrahams,as Eric Liddell,as Lord Andrew Lindsay,as Sam Mussabini,as Master of Trinity,as Jennie Liddell,as Sybil Gordon,as Jackson Scholz,as Aubrey Montague,as Master of Caius,as Charles Paddock,as Lord Cadogan,as Duke of Sutherland,as Sandy McGrath,as Clare,as Prince of Wales,as George Andre,as Henry Stallard,as President, Gilbert and Sullivan Society,as President, Cambridge Athletic Club,as Secretary, Gilbert and Sullivan Society,as Head Porter, Caius College,as Rev J.D.

Lady Jane Grey's sickly cousin, who becomes Edward VI upon the death of Henry VIII, is on the threshold of death himself. The Protestant powers-that-be, fearing that England will fall under Catholic rule, contrive to marry off Edward VI's most likely successor Lady Jane to the wastrelly Guilford Dudley (Cary Elwes), the future Duke of Suffolk. The dying Edward is coerced into naming Jane as his successor. Jane is forced to assume the throne, attempting to impose reforms on the corrupt Protestant government during her brief reign. A coup led by Jane's cousin Princess Mary (Jane Lapotaire) results in the ouster, and eventual execution, of Queen Jane and her consort. The story is told through anti-establishment themes; teen-agers Lady Jane and Guilford Dudley are seen as the only hope for a brighter future, making their deaths all the more tragic.

Grizzled and older, former cop Max (Mel Gibson) roams the Australian desert in a camel-drawn vehicle -- until father-and-son thieves Jebediah Sr. (Bruce Spence) and Jr. (Adam Cockburn) use their jury-rigged airplane to steal his possessions and means of transportation. Max soon winds up in Bartertown, a cesspool of post-apocalyptic capitalism powered by methane-rich pig manure and overseen by two competing overlords, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and Master (Angelo Rossitto), a crafty midget who rides around on the back of his hulking underling, Blaster (Paul Larsson). Seeking to re-equip himself, Max strikes a deal with the haughty Aunty to kill Blaster in ritualized combat inside Thunderdome, a giant jungle gym where Bartertown's conflicts are played out in a postmodern update of blood and circuses. Although Max manages to fell the mighty Blaster, he refuses to kill him after realizing the brute is actually a retarded boy. Aunty's henchmen murder Blaster nonetheless, then punish Max for violating the law that ""Two men enter, one man leaves."" Lashed to the back of a hapless pack animal and sent out into a sandstorm, a near-death Max is rescued by a band of tribal children and teens. The descendants of the victims of an airplane crash, the kids inhabit a lush valley and wait for the day when Captain Walker, the plane's pilot, will return to lead them back to civilization. Some of the children, refusing to believe that Max isn't Walker and that the glorious cities of their mythology no longer exist, set off in search of civilization on their own.

It is 1971, and the Vietnam War has not yet ended. Gardner Barnes (Costner) has extended his college years by six semesters in an attempt to stave off the rapidly approaching future, Kenneth (Sam Robards) has just canceled his wedding in a drunken look at reality, Lester (Brian Cesak) loves alcohol and tags along with the group just to have a good time, Dorman (Chuck Bush) is devoted to existentialism and flights of poetic fancy, and Phil (Judd Nelson) is barely a member of the group because he is consorting with the enemy: he is a member of ROTC. This unlikely mismatch cavorts through several classic college pranks, among them taking bets on daredevil acts like skydiving into the middle of nowhere.

D. Bales, the fearless, quick-witted fire chief of a Washington State resort town. Bales' most trusted fireman is the handsome but tongue-tied Chris McDonell (Rick Rossovich). Both men are in love with the beautiful Roxanne Kowalski (Darryl Hannah), but Bales, adorned with a huge nose that makes Bob Hope look like Nanette Fabray, is convinced that he's too homely to win Roxanne's heart. Thus, in the self-sacrificing tradition of Cyrano de Bergerac, Bales courts Roxanne vicariously by feeding his rival Chris the proper romantic words and phrases. The inherent pathos in Roxanne is offset by moments of slapstick, notably the scene wherein C. D. Bales vanquishes a pair of hooligans with a tennis racket. Steve Martin himself is credited with the screenplay for Roxanne, though he generously cites Edmond Rostand as his inspiration.;Fred Schepisi;Steve Martin;/celebrity/steve_martin;as C. D.

Lee is introduced to the study of martial arts as a child living in Hong Kong by his father (Ric Young); the father dreamed that a demonic armored dragon would take his son from him, and wanted young Bruce to be able to protect himself. Bruce continues his training as he grows to adulthood, and after the cocky teenaged Lee (Jason Scott Lee, no relation to Bruce) seriously injures a prominent British citizen while fighting a gang of troublemakers at a dance, he's sent to San Francisco. While working as a dishwasher, Bruce begins to study philosophy, and in time develops a personal martial arts discipline, Jeet Kune-Do, which blends Kung Fu fighting techniques with lessons gained from his philosophical research. Bruce decides to open a martial arts academy on the advice of his fiancÃƒÂ©e Linda (Lauren Holly); Linda and Bruce encounter resistance as a mixed-race couple, especially from Linda's mother Vivian (Michael Learned), and Bruce earns the enmity of traditional Chinese martial arts experts for his new style. But after a strong showing in several public tournaments, Bruce's fighting skill and charisma attracts the attention of TV producer Bill Krieger (Robert Wagner). Bruce is cast as Kato, the karate-trained sidekick on the series The Green Hornet, and while the show is short-lived in America, it's a huge success in Asia, leading to a series of films based around Bruce's remarkable fighting skills. Sadly, shortly before the release of the film that would make him a major screen star in the United States, Enter The Dragon, a mysterious brain disorder sends Lee into a coma that soon kills him. In a tragedy with eerie timing, Bruce Lee's real-life son Brandon Lee died shortly before this film was released, the result of an accidental shooting while completing the picture The Crow.";Rob Cohen;Edward Khmara,John Raffo,Rob Cohen;/celebrity/edward_khmara,/celebrity/john_raffo,/celebrity/rob_cohen;as Bruce Lee,as Linda Lee,as Bill Krieger,as Vivian Emery,as Gussie Yang,as Philip Tan,as Bruce's Father,as Jerome Sprout,,as The Demon,,as Johnny Sun,as Luke Sun,as Joe Henderson,as Raoul,as Principal Elder,as Isabelle,as Brandon,as Virginie,as Young Bruce,as Raoul's father,as Shannon,as Mr Clarke,as History Teacher,as April,as Report hite's woman,as Mr. Ho,as Chef,as Chef,as Nunnemacher,as Benny Sayles,as Tad Overton,as Green Hornet,as Green Hornet Director,as Bad Guy,as Assistant Director,as Ed Parker,as Kreiger's Butler,as Doctor,as Sherry Schnell,as `Big Boss' Director,as Maitre D',as `Enter the Dragon' Director,as Studio Executive,as Stunt Coordinator,as Heckler,as Elder,as Yip Man;Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story;https://resizing.flixster.com/qCgHhaJse4GkyzUX-8zsVX3MLng=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDM1MztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTE3OTsxNTcy

The tanuki -- a badger-like creature often portrayed with big round eyes, a large Buddha-like belly, and long pendulous testicles resting by its feet -- is a beloved figure in Japanese myth, viewed both as a fun-loving bringer of fortune and a shape-changing trickster. Pom Poko opens with a group of tanuki fighting amongst each other for the increasingly scarce resources of their forest. Soon the group realizes that the real enemy is not their fellow tanuki, but suburban sprawl. Lead by their tough-talking matriarch, Oroku Baba, they use their lycanthropic abilities in a campaign to thwart the developers. Suddenly tarps fall on windshields and obstacles appear before bulldozers, sending the lot careening off the road and into a gulch. Unfortunately, the tide of progress is not that easily turned.

Now the story is brought to the screen yet again, as Jodie Foster stars as Leonowens, hired by the king of Thailand (Chow Yun-Fat) in the 19th century to help care for his children. The king wants the best for his children, but Anna soon discovers that he is a strong-willed but quixotic leader, and her stay in Thailand becomes a struggle for power with romantic overtones, as they decide who will have authority over the royal youngsters. Anna and the King was directed by Andy Tennant, best known for his 1998 variation on the Cinderella story, Ever After. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi;Andy Tennant;Steve Meerson,Peter Krikes;/celebrity/steve_meerson,/celebrity/peter_krikes;as Anna Leonowens,as King Mongkut,as Tuptim,as Louis,as The Kralahome,as General Alak,as Prince Chowfa,as Princess Fa-Ying,as Prince Chulalongkorn,as Moonshee,as Beebe,as Lady Thiang,as Lord John Bradley,as Lady Bradley,as Mycroft Kincaid,as Khun Phra Balat,as Phim,as Noi,as Nikorn,as Pitak,as Interpreter,as Lady Jao Jom Manda Ung,as King Chulalongkorn,as Captain Blake,as Scarfaced Leader,as Justice Phya Phrom,as Second Judge,as Third Judge,as Lady of Court No. 1,as Lady of Court No. 2,as Lady of Court No. 3,as Lady of Court No. 4,as Lady of Court No. 5,as La-Ore,as Scout No. 1,as Scout No. 2,as Siamese Trader,as Shipping Dock Woman,as Mercenary,as Distraught Villager;Anna and the King;https://resizing.flixster.com/kw8XbG_x6WdTaTZlzCikcoJkoV8=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTI5MDI2MjtqOzE3NTQ1OzEyMDA7MTUwNjsyMDA4

He is, however, no monster; faced with his crew's increasing laxity after an idyllic visit to Tahiti (the search for breadfruit takes second place to limitless sex with the island girls), Bligh is forced to resort to flogging and other such means to keep his men in line. Mr. Christian (Mel Gibson), formerly Bligh's friend, is of little use to the captain, having fallen in love with a native girl himself.

The early part of the film focuses on the training and adolescent relationships of two young men who are destined to perform in the famed Peking Opera. Due to the arduous and complex nature of their training, the story begins when one of them (nicknamed Douzi) (played as an adult by Hong Kong singer Leslie Cheung) is deposited at the school by his mother when he is quite a young boy. He becomes friends with a lad called Shitou (Zhang Fengyi as an adult), and their friendship goes through a variety of ups and downs occasioned by the fact that Douzi is homosexual, and Shitou is married. They do not ever appear to have had a sexual romance, but Douzi certainly resents his reduced access to his friend after he marries.

Every day, he and his friends Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman as not THAT Michael Bolton), suffer endless indignities and humiliations in their soulless workspace from their soulless boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). For Peter, stuck in his cookie-cutter apartment with paper-thin walls and IKEA furniture, every day is worse than the one before it -- so every day is the worst of his life. To cap it off, Initech has hired a pair of ""efficiency experts"" to downsize the company. One Friday night, Peter's soon to be ex-girlfriend Anne (Alexandra Wentworth) forces him to go to an occupational hypnotherapist to relieve work stress. While Peter is under hypnosis, the therapist keels over and dies. As he never snaps out of his hypnotic state, Peter has a new outlook on life. If something annoys him, he just ignores it or walks away from it. He is completely relaxed and enjoying life for the first time in a long time. On Monday, Peter skips work and sleeps in. He gets up for lunch and drives down to a restaurant next to his office and asks the waitress he's had a crush on, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), on a date. When Peter stops into the office to pick up his organizer, he's called in to talk to the efficiency experts. Relaxed and friendly, Peter charms them as he describes everything wrong with the office, including his boss. Even as Peter now appears at work only as the mood strikes him, the experts decide he's management material and give him a promotion even as they lay off the hardworking Samir and Michael. Peter then convinces his friends to exact revenge on Initech based upon an idea from Superman III. Not everything works out quite as planned. Office Space originated from writer/director Mike Judge's first animated short of the same name, created in 1991.

A primitive homo sapiens tribe huddles around a natural fire source for comfort and survival. When that source is extinguished, tribesmen Naoh (Everett McGill), Amoukar (Ron Perlman), and Gaw (Nameer El-Kadi) are sent out on a ""quest for fire."" After several days of wandering through the prehistoric landscape (the film was shot in Canada, Scotland, Iceland, and Kenya), the three come across a cannibal tribe that knows how to produce fire; they save a young girl, Ika (Rae Dawn Chong), from the clutches of the cannibals, with the hope that she'll reveal the secret. Based on a novel by J. H. Rosny Sr., Quest for Fire convincingly creates the world of the past and believably molds its characters within the context of their surroundings and their limited knowledge of the world. The credibility factor is aided by technical consultants Desmond Morris and Anthony Burgess, who respectively developed a set of gestures and a simplistic language for the Ulams and Ivakas.

Alice encounters Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a former member of Umbrella's internal defense team. Forming an alliance with mercenary-for-hire Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) and his cohorts, this tiny band of survivors seeks out Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), Umbrella's top scientist and one of the only men with the know-how to find a solution to the zombie menace; however, they discover that Ashford's cooperation comes with a price -- the scientist's daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), is missing, and he'll help Alice and her partners only if Angie is returned to him safe and sound.

Disgusted by Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett's decree that several ponies make up for a cowhand's slashing a whore's face, Big Whiskey prostitutes, led by fierce Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher), take justice into their own hands and put a $1000 bounty on the lives of the perpetrators. Notorious outlaw-turned-hog farmer William Munny (Eastwood) is sought out by neophyte gunslinger the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) to go with him to Big Whiskey and collect the bounty. While Munny insists, ""I ain't like that no more,"" he needs the bounty money for his children, and the two men convince Munny's clean-living comrade Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join them in righting a wrong done to a woman. Little Bill (Oscar-winner Gene Hackman), however, has no intention of letting any bounty hunters impinge on his iron-clad authority. When pompous gunman English Bob (Richard Harris) arrives in Big Whiskey with pulp biographer W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) in tow, Little Bill beats Bob senseless and promises to tell Beauchamp the real story about violent frontier life and justice. But when Munny, the true unwritten legend, comes to town, everyone soon learns a harsh lesson about the price of vindictive bloodshed and the malleability of ideas like ""justice."" ""I don't deserve this,"" pleads Little Bill.

Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) have been summoned by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to join him on a voyage to Zion, the last outpost of free human beings on Earth. Neo and Trinity's work together has been complicated by the fact the two are involved in a serious romantic relationship. Upon their arrival in Zion, Morpheus locks horns with rival Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix) and encounters his old flame Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has returned with some surprises for Neo, most notably the ability to replicate himself as many times as he pleases. Neo makes his way to The Oracle (Gloria Foster), who informs him that if he wishes to save humankind, he must unlock ""The Source,"" which means having to release The Key Maker (Randall Duk Kim) from the clutches of Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). While Merovingian refuses to cooperate, his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci), angry at her husband's dalliances with other women, offers to help, but only in exchange for a taste of Neo's affections. With The Keymaker in tow, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are chased by Merovingian's henchmen: a pair of deadly albino twins (Neil Rayment and Adrian Rayment). Filmed primarily in Australia and California (the extended chase scene was shot on a stretch of highway build specifically for the production outside of San Francisco), The Matrix Reloaded was produced in tandem with the third film in the series, The Matrix Revolutions. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Lana Wachowski,Lilly Wachowski,The Wachowski Brothers;Lilly Wachowski,Lana Wachowski;/celebrity/andy_wachowski,/celebrity/larry_wachowski;as Neo,as Morpheus,as Trinity,as Agent Smith,as Persephone,as The Oracle,as Niobe,as Link,as Commander Lock,as Merovingian,as The Keymaker,as Zee,as Councillor Hamann,as The Architect,as Twin No. 1,as Twin No. 2,as Agent Johnson,as Ghost,as Sparks,as Kali,as Wurm,as Agent Jackson,as Agent Thompson,as Councillor Dillard,as Seraph,as Councillor West,as Link's Niece,as Link's Nephew,,as Radio Man,as Lock's Lieutenant,as Soren,as Vector,as Priestess,as Bane,as Zion Controller,as Vector,as Zion Virtual Control Operator,as Zion Gate Operator,as Operator on the Vigilant,as Ice,as Corrupt,as Maggie,as Maitre D' at Le Vrai,as Beautiful Woman at Le Vrai,as Ballard,as Abel,as Mauser,as Colt,as AK,as Officer Wirtz,as Mifune,as Cain,as Roland,as Ajax,as Abel,as Binary,as Tirant,as Cas,as Malachi,as Michael Popper, the `Kid',as Axel,as Thomas Anderson (age 12),as Power Station Guard,as Thomas Anderson (age 4),as Thomas Anderson (age 2),as A.P.U.

Romero's 1968 classic follows the original almost shot-for-shot, so quality comparisons are somewhat pointless. The film was clearly made for younger viewers who refuse to watch black-and-white films, no matter how good they may be. The result is passable, but the very fact that the original was made 22 years before makes this version seem almost dated in its restraint. By the time of its release, Romero had already geometrically raised the gore quotient with Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Day of the Dead (1985), so Savini's starting back at square one further lessened the impact of this pointless retread. If this version has anything to offer, it is Patricia Tallman's engaging lead performance as a gun-toting independent woman, one of this film's few elements not lifted wholesale from Romero.;Tom Savini;George A.

Gene also has to defend himself against Kenny (D.W. Brown) the class bully while trying to work out a borderline relationship with his widowed father, who has zero tolerance for his often wild escapades. As Jonathan and Gene handle life's challenges, the 1950s emerges as a potent presence on screen in the form of background setting, including movies and music, as well as dress and customs that were popular in that distinctive era.;Mel Damski,Noel Black;Noel Black;/celebrity/noel_black;as Jonathan,as Bunny,as Marilyn,as Gene,as Kenny,as Claire Miller,as Mr. Travis,as Claude Harbrough,as Ted,as T.J.,as Mr.Hewitt,as Robbie,as Harry Horner,as Mr. Hartman,as Mr. Harstadt,as Mrs. Newell,as Mr. McCauley,as Police Officer,as Drive-In Manager,as Carhop,as Truck Driver,as Girl at Drive-In,as Rosalie,as Mrs. McCauley;Mischief;https://resizing.flixster.com/1mSiZ9KJXsbKw9tJkqXS2n8a2gE=/206x305/v1.bTsxMjIwMTQwMDtqOzE3NDY2OzEyMDA7MzU1OzUwMA

He offers her a ride in his limousine and soon they meet in his ""bachelor room"" where they revel in a wide variety of creative sexual encounters. However, they both realize their love is doomed.

That same network also becomes a battlefield for Tokyo's Section Nine security force, which has been charged with apprehending the master hacker known only as the Puppet Master. Spearheading the investigation is Major Motoko Kusanagi, who -- like many in her department -- is a cyborg officer, far more powerful than her human appearance would suggest. And yet as the Puppet Master, who is even capable of hacking human minds, leaves a trail of victims robbed of their memories, Kusanagi ponders the very nature of her existence: is she purely an artificial construct, or is there more? What, exactly, is the ""ghost"" -- her essence -- in her cybernetic ""shell""? When Section Six gets involved in the case, she is forced to confront the fact that there is more here than meets the eye, and that the Puppet Master may hold some of the answers she seeks.

Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a fresh-faced Los Angeles Police Department rookie anxious to join the elite narcotics squad headed up by 13-year veteran Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris has agreed to give Hoyt a shot at joining his team with a one-day ride-along during which Hoyt must prove his mettle. As the day wears on, however, it becomes increasingly clear to the greenhorn that his experienced mentor has blurred the line between right and wrong to an alarming degree, enforcing his own morally compromised code of ethics and street justice.

At the behest of Iron John-esque Lewis (Burt Reynolds), the less adventuresome Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) agree to canoe down an uncharted section of the river before a dam project ruins the region. After warnings from the grimy, impoverished locals, and Drew's tuneful yet ominous ""Dueling Banjos"" encounter with a mute inbred boy, the four men embark on their trip, exulting in the beauty of nature and the initial thrill of the rapids. The next day, however, things begin to take a turn for the worse when Bobby and Ed decide to rest on shore after becoming separated from Lewis and Drew. Two rifle-wielding mountain men (Bill McKinney and Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward) emerge from the woods, tying up Ed while one of them rapes Bobby and makes him ""squeal like a pig."" Lewis and Drew rescue them, but the attack irrevocably changes the tenor of the journey. As the river gets rougher and rougher, the men come to nightmarish grips with what it means to survive outside the safety net of ""civilization."" ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi";John Boorman;James Dickey,Dale Dye;/celebrity/james-dickey,/celebrity/dale_dye;as Lewis Medlock,as Ed Gentry,,as Bobby Trippe AKA Chubby,as Drew Ballinger,as Old Man,as Lonny,as First Griner,as Second Griner,as Mountain Man,as Toothless Man,as First Deputy,as Sheriff,as 2nd Deputy,as Ambulance Driver,as Highway Patrolman (uncredited),as Doctor,as Doctor,as Deputy Queen,as Nurse,as Mrs. Biddiford,as Taxi Driver,as Toothless Man,as Boy at Gas Station,as Martha Gentry,as Ed's Boy;Deliverance;https://resizing.flixster.com/j0l4DmeDWn8JN3g3cybDaYi2TJU=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2OTkxNjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper. ~ Jason Clark, Rovi";Jean-Jacques Annaud;Alain Godard,Jean-Jacques Annaud;/celebrity/alain_godard,/celebrity/jeanjacques_annaud;as Zaitsev,as Danilov,as Konig,as Tania,as Khrushchev,as Koulikov,as Mother Filipov,as Sasha,as Von Paulus,as Ludmilla,as Volodya,as Anton,as Sacha,as Red Army General,as Sacha,as German Nomcom,as Grandfather,as Young Vassili,as Comrade in Train,as Fat Colonel,as Aide de Camp,as Blond Captain,as Captain with Lighter,as Stubborn Feldwebel,as Politruk/Sniper,as Russian Noncom,as Political Officer,as Sweating Officer,as Stammering Officer,as Spotter,as Corpse Robber,as Female Russian Typist,as Paulus' Aide de Camp,as Stealing Photographer,as Captain at Headquarters,as Russian Lieutenant,as Comrade in Shelter,as Pravda Interviewer,as Izvestija Interviewer,as Kranaja Zvezda Interviewer,as Russian Reporter,as Footsoldier,as Woman Plucking Eyebrows,as Woman Officer,as Athletic Female Sniper,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Politruk,as Junior Politruk,as Senior Politruk,as Russian Trench Officer,as Russian Officer,as Russian Noncom,as Russian Noncom,as Tchechen Sniper/Sniper/Russian Officer,as Gaunt German Prisoner,as Sniper,as Sniper,as Female Russian Radio Operator;Enemy at the Gates;https://resizing.flixster.com/IaVjzV-prI9iVN3cdgyXTw0DpJk=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2ODkzNjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Instead, a series of mishaps result in their respective deportations to Mexico. Desperate to get back to the states so they can perform in their band's gig later that night, Cheech and Chong unwittingly agree to drive a very unique car across the border -- rather than steel and various metal bits, the vehicle is constructed entirely out of marijuana. Back in the States and accompanied by two extraordinarily out-of-it female hitchhikers, the stoned group meanders about in an attempt to get their musical performance together, and narrowly escapes from local law enforcement agencies on numerous occasions despite their complete inability to realize they were being tailed to begin with. The incredibly low-budget movie surprised critics, grossed millions, spawned a series of lesser follow-up films, and cemented Cheech & Chong's cult-status among potheads across the globe. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi";Lou Adler,Tommy Chong;Tommy Chong,Cheech Marin;/celebrity/tommy_chong,/celebrity/cheech_marin;as Pedro,as Man Stoner,as Sgt.

He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red.

Structured in five sections contrasting home and war, the film opens in Clairton, PA, as Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Stan (John Cazale, in his last film) celebrate the wedding of their friend Steve (John Savage) and go on a final deer hunt before the men leave for Vietnam. Mike treats hunting as a test of skill, lecturing Stan about the value of ""one shot"" deer slaying and brushing off Nick's urgings to appreciate nature's beauty. As Mike ruminates post-hunt, the film cuts to the horror of Vietnam, where the men are captured by Vietcong soldiers who force Mike and Nick to play Russian roulette for the V.C.'s amusement. Mike turns the game to his advantage so they can escape captivity, but the men are permanently scarred by the episode. Steve loses his legs; Nick vanishes in the Saigon Russian roulette parlors. Mike returns alone to Clairton a changed man, as he rejects the killing of the deer hunt and finds solace with Nick's old girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). Disgusted by the antics of his male cohorts at home, Mike decides to bring Steve back from a veterans' hospital, and he returns to Saigon to find Nick. As Saigon falls, Mike discovers how far gone Nick is; the survivors gather in Clairton for a funeral breakfast, singing an impromptu rendition of ""God Bless America.""";Michael Cimino;Deric Washburn,Michael Cimino,Louis Garfinkle,Quinn K.

Hayek ages some 30 years onscreen as she charts Frida Kahlo's life from feisty schoolgirl to Diego Rivera protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©e to world-renowned artist in her own right. Frida details Kahlo's affluent upbringing in Mexico City, and her nurturing relationship with her traditional mother (Patricia Reyes Spindola) and philosophical father (Roger Rees). Having already suffered the crippling effects of polio, Kahlo sustains further injuries when a city bus accident nearly ends her life. But in her bed-ridden state, the young artist produces dozens upon dozens of pieces; when she recovers, she presents them to the legendary -- and legendarily temperamental -- Rivera (Alfred Molina), who takes her under his wing as an artist, a political revolutionary, and, inevitably, a lover. But their relationship is fraught with trouble, as the philandering Rivera traverses the globe painting murals, and Kahlo languishes in obscurity, longing to make her mark on her own. Frida was directed by Julie Taymor, whose Broadway production of The Lion King won her international acclaim. ~ Michael Hastings, Rovi";Julie Taymor;Clancy Sigal,Diane Lake,Gregory Nava,Anna Thomas,Rodrigo GarcÃƒÂ­a;/celebrity/clancy_sigal,/celebrity/diane_lake,/celebrity/gregory_nava,/celebrity/anna_thomas,/celebrity/rodrigo_garcia_3;as Frida Kahlo,as Diego Rivera,as Leon Trotsky,as Cristina Kahlo,as Tina Modotti,as David Alfaro Siqueiros,as Nelson Rockefeller,as Lupe Marin,as Guillermo Kahlo,as Alejandro Gomez,as Matilde Kahlo,as Natalia Trotsky,as Gracie;Frida;https://resizing.flixster.com/gByUza7rk5ieDRvbS3Yd9lvvQYU=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3NjExMztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

The energetic and often extremely raunchy set begins with a series of impressions, most involving some celebrity becoming upset at Murphy for unflattering jokes: a squeaky-voiced Michael Jackson threatens to pummel Murphy into the ground; an enraged Mr. T is confused by Murphy's verbal sleight of hand; and even paragon of calm Bill Cosby loses his cool while chastising the comic for his dirty mouth. After some digressions finding humor in racial differences and other matters, Murphy proceeds into the centerpiece of his act, a series of routines about contemporary relationships between men and women, including an extended bit about what life would be like were he to become married -- jokes that some have criticized as heavily misogynist. Finally, Murphy concludes his set with an extended, comedic but sympathetic, reminiscence about his childhood and family life, a tone that matches that of the film's prologue -- a fictional re-creation of Murphy, in his childhood, entertaining a family gathering with what turns out to be an inappropriately off-color joke.";Robert Townsend;Eddie Murphy,Keenen Ivory Wayans,Robert Townsend;/celebrity/eddie_murphy,/celebrity/keenen_ivory_wayans,/celebrity/robert_townsend;,as Himself,as Eddie's Uncle,as Eddie's Sister,as Eddie's Mother,as Eddie's Father;Eddie Murphy Raw;https://resizing.flixster.com/5aFNGZ2nojIxcRcp5NkDoHM9ouU=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODU2NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUxODsyMDI0

Frank, down on his luck, is presented with the case of his life when he is approached by the family of a woman who has been left in a coma following an operation in a large Catholic hospital. Helped by his assistant Mickey (Jack Warden), he agrees to take the case, hoping for a fast settlement. When he visits the victim in the hospital, he becomes emotionally involved, turns down a sizable settlement offer made by the hospital, and decides to bring the case to trial despite the formidable opposition of the Church and its lawyer, Newman (James Mason). He is also assisted by his new girlfriend, Laura (Charlotte Rampling), a woman who turns out to have an unusual past. Oscar-nominated for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"" (Lumet) as well as for ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" (David Mamet from a novel by Barry Reed), The Verdict is an outstanding, if not very legally accurate, courtroom drama; Frank's decision to try the case without telling the family of the victim of the settlement offer would probably lead to his real-life disbarment.

Mackye Gruber make their directorial debut with the sci-fi thriller The Butterfly Effect. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher with facial hair) wants to free himself from his disturbing childhood memories. As a kid, he often blacked out for long periods of time and tried to detail his life in a journal. As a young adult, he revisits the journal entries to figure out the truth about his troubled childhood friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). When he discovers he can travel back in time in order to set things right, he tries to save his beloved friends. However, he finds out that relatively minor changes can make major problems for the future. The Butterfly Effect also stars Eric Stoltz, Ethan Suplee, and Melora Walters. The title was inspired by the story A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury. ~ Andrea LeVasseur, Rovi;Eric Bress,J. Mackye Gruber;Eric Bress,J.

Unknown to most people, the world is crowded with spirits both good and evil who walk among us in human guise. One of the few who can see these spirits is John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), but the responsibility of his vision is more than he can stand, and he tries to kill himself. Saved from death, Constantine must now atone for his actions by acting as a guardian in the middle ground between Paradise and Hell. Constantine also makes the acquaintance of Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a police detective who becomes aware of his unusual gift while looking into the death of her sister; he leads her into the unknown world of the spirits and soon circumstances demand that they join forces in a desperate bid to save humanity from evil. Constantine also features Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare, and Gavin Rossdale, the latter best known as the lead singer of the rock group Bush. Michelle Monaghan (Made of Honor) was originally in the film (cast as a half-breed demon) but director Francis Lawrence cut her scenes. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Francis Lawrence;Frank A.

After a string of robberies that left a river of blood in the Geckos' wake, the sadistic siblings head to Mexico to live the good life. To get over the border, they kidnap Jacob Fuller, a widowed preacher played by Harvey Keitel, and his two children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). Once south of the border, the quintet park their RV at a rough-and-tumble trucker bar called The Titty Twister, where Seth and Richie are supposed to meet a local thug. After a couple of drinks, they realize that they're not in a typical bar, as the entire place begins to teem with vicious, blood-sucking vampires. With the odds stacked greatly against them, the Fullers and Geckos team together in hopes of defeating the creatures of the night.

Lemmon portrays ""the great American tragedy"" as upwardly mobile garment manufacturer Harry Stoner, whose underhanded business tactics are beginning to catch up with him, and whose keeping-up-appearances lifestyle has forced him into bankruptcy. The script, by producer Steve Shagan, does nothing to endear us to Stoner: he flagrantly cheats on his wife, arranges business deals by servicing his clients with prostitutes, and finally agrees to torch his warehouse to collect the insurance money, all the while paying empty lip service to his lost ideals. Nonetheless, one ""feels"" for Stoner throughout, especially when he breaks down while giving a speech to his assembled buyers, imagining that the audience is populated by his dead army buddies, who gave up their lives to make the world safe for good-for-nothings like himself.

The scene is a rundown Hispanic community in New Mexico, bordering a posh housing development. In full control of the local water rights, the powers-that-be are secure in the belief that they'll be able to expand their development without resistance from the locals. No one can foresee that impoverished farmer Joe Mondragon (Chick Vennera), during a burst of frustrated rage, will accidentally open a heretofore hidden sluice, thereby providing free water for his bean field. At first, the locals are against Mondragon's ""insurrection,"" reasoning that the new housing development will provide jobs. But with the help of Charlie Bloom (John Heard), a burned-out '60s activist who now runs the community newspaper, Mondragon becomes the hero of the hour, the spiritual leader of an ever-growing ""no development"" movement. The evil land developers send their minions to intimidate or coerce Mondragon; each time, however, he is seemingly protected from harm by divine intervention. When Mondragon is forced to shoot a trespasser on his land, it looks as though his luck has run out. Chased into the hills by private detective Kyril Montana (Christopher Walken), Mondragon is once more rescued in the nick of time by what appears to be a miracle. And there are more wonders to behold before fade-out time! Whimsical, yes, but thanks to its hand-picked ensemble cast (including Sonia Braga, RubÃƒÂ©n Blades, James Gammon, Daniel Stern, Freddy Fender, M. Emmet Walsh, and Melanie Griffith) the film remains totally credible throughout. Adapted by John Nichols and David Ward from Nichols' own novel, The Milagro Beanfield War may be the most likeable ""liberal-tract"" film of the 1980s.

People are few and far between, living as sailors or on rickety atolls made from scrap metal; in this time, dry land is considered a myth and dirt and water have become the most valuable currency. The film begins as a mysterious Mariner aboard his ingenious trimaran urinates carefully into a small jar. He then pours the golden liquid into a filtration device that purifies it and makes it drinkable. The Mariner is self sufficient and eschews humanity, except for occasional stops for supplies. He is different from other humans in that he has developed functional gills and has webbed feet. Such a mutation makes him a pariah. He cruises into a rusty atoll and tries to exchange dirt for supplies. The half-crazy people within the fortress end up putting him in a cage and planning to recycle him in a bubbling vat of green effluvium. Just before he is to die, the fortress is attacked by a flotilla of Smokers (tobacco addicted sea bikers) led by the bald, one-eyed and crazy Deacon who has come to search for a little girl with a strange tattoo on her back that is said to be a map leading to dry land.

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career.

Fresh out of residence at a Washington D.C. hospital, hot-shot plastic surgeon Ben Stone (Michael J. Fox) hops in his Porsche and is headed for California, where a lucrative practice in Beverly Hills awaits. However, Ben accidentally plows into a fence in Grady, South Carolina; the wreck puts Ben's car out of commission, and the town's mayor, Nick Nicholson (David Ogden Stiers), sees to it that Ben is sentenced to perform community service while he's waiting to get his car back on the road. For a week, Ben will serve as the community's general practitioner, filling in for the aging Dr. Hogue (Barnard Hughes). Many of the locals go out of their way to make Ben feel welcome, since they need a new full-time doctor and hope he'd be interested in staying on a permanent basis. Ben isn't especially interested until he meets Lou (Julie Warner), a beautiful, intelligent, and feisty local woman he first meets as she's enjoying a morning skinny-dip. Ben now finds himself wondering what the odds are of winning her away from her less-than-brilliant boyfriend Hank (Woody Harrelson). Bridget Fonda has a memorable supporting role as Nancy Lee, who doesn't make much of a secret of her attraction to Ben. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Michael Caton-Jones;Neil B.

In the racially-divided 1940s, Fort Neal, Louisiana, is a military base where black soldiers are sent not to fight in WWII but to play baseball against other armed forces teams. The murder of a black sergeant, Waters (Adolph Caesar) brings an investigator, Captain Davenport (Howard E. Rollins, Jr.) to the base. Davenport, the first black officer that most of the men have ever met, suspects that a pair of white men were responsible for Waters' death, but his probe reveals that nearly everyone, regardless of skin color, had ample reason to kill the loathsome but pitiable Waters. The cast of A Soldier's Story features early supporting performances from several African-American actors who would go on to greater prominence, including Denzel Washington, David Alan Grier, and Robert Townsend.

Even as a child, she yearns for a more glamorous life than her birthright promises. As she leaves Miss Pinkerton's Academy at Chiswick, Becky resolves to conquer English society by any means possible. She deploys all of her wit, guile, and sexuality as she makes her way up into high society during the first quarter of the 19th century. Becky's ascension to the heights of society commences when she gains employment as governess to the daughters of eccentric Sir Pitt Crawley. Becky wins over the children, and the Crawley family's rich spinster Aunt Matilda as well. The rural Hampshire household comes to find her indispensable, and Matilda comes to confide in the bright young woman. But Becky knows that she cannot be a true part of English society until she moves to the city. When Matilda invites her to come live in London, Becky eagerly accepts. There, Becky is reunited with her best friend Amelia Sedley, who-having grown up comfortably--does not share Becky's more brazen ambitions. Hewing close to the family she already knows so well, Becky secretly marries dashing heir Rawdon Crawley but when Matilda discovers their union, she casts the newlyweds out. When Napoleon invades Europe, Rawdon bravely reports to the front lines. Pregnant Becky stands by distraught newlywed Amelia, whose own husband George Osborne is also called to fight. When George does not survive the Battle of Waterloo, Becky's friendship with Amelia is strained beyond repair. Becky is reunited with Rawdon and gives birth to a boy, but, post-war, money and comforts are sparse for the trio. More intent than ever on gaining acceptance into London society and living well, Becky finds a patron in the powerful Marquess of Steyne. Steyne's whims enable Becky to realize her dreams, but the ultimate cost may be too high for her.;Mira Nair;Julian Fellows,Mark Skeet,Matthew Faulk,Julian Fellowes;/celebrity/julian_fellows,/celebrity/mark_skeet,/celebrity/matthew_faulk,/celebrity/julian_fellowes;as Becky Sharp,as Rawdon Crawley,as William Dobbin,as Amelia Sedley,as Miss Matilda Crawley,as Mr. Osborne,as Sir Pitt Crawley,as Joseph Sedley,as The Marquess of Steyne,as Lady Southdown,as Mr. Sedley,as Mrs. Sedley,as Pitt Crawley,as Young Becky,as Francis Sharp,as George Osborne,as Miss Pinkerton,as Ms. Green,as Miss Pinkerton's Crone,as Ms. Green,as Biju,as Gambler,as Queen's Crawley Mail Coach Driver,as Lady Crawley,as Lady Crawley,as Young Rose Crawley,as Young Celia Crawley,as Horrocks,as Lady Jane Sheepshanks,as Rhoda Swartz,as Lady Steyne,as Lady Gaunt,as Lady George,as Firkin,as Doctor,as Maria Osborne,as Coalman,as Auctioneer,as Lord Bareacres,as Lady Bareacres,as Lord Darlington,as Lady Darlington,as General Tufto,as Mr. Raggles,as Curzon Street Footman,as Nursemaid,as Rawdy,as Georgy,as Mr. Moss,as Desert Beauty,as Officer,as Rose Crawley,as Celia Crawley,as Little Pitt,as Mr. Wenham,as The King,as Coventry Island Man,as Casino Boy,as Casino Boy,as Casino Boy,as German Official,as Casino Stranger,as Young Georgy,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,as `Slave Dance' Dancer,;Vanity Fair;https://resizing.flixster.com/QS5kSJ7gs0qeQYEb7TNRZIE8lNE=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDgyMTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MjI1MDszMDAw

However, Ralph's big ideas usually take the form of half-baked get-rich-quick schemes which invariably fail, much to the chagrin of his long-suffering wife, Alice (Gabrielle Union). But Ralph always has a loyal ally in his best friend and upstairs neighbor, Ed Norton (Mike Epps), a sewer worker who also has a wife who is weary of his antics, Trixie (Regina Hall). Alice and Trixie have a plan to come up with the down payment for a dream house: a suburban duplex that's being eyed by a shady developer (Eric Stoltz). But when Ralph and Ed decide to spend their savings on training a stray mutt for the New Jersey dog races, they threaten both couples' futures.

Agent Jay (Will Smith) has become a high-ranking member of the Men in Black, the secret government task force designed to deal with unruly visitors from other worlds, while his former cohort, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), had his memory wiped clean and now lives a simple but contented life as a mailman. However, an especially nasty alien threat has reared its not-so-ugly head; Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a shape-shifting Kylothian alien who is in pursuit of another escaped visitor who holds the key to powers that would allow her to destroy the world. Making Serleena all the more dangerous is the fact she's taken on the appearance of a lingerie model, making her irresistible to most men. When the rampaging Serleena takes control of the MIB offices, Jay is forced to turn to the only man who can help him save the world -- the former Agent Kay. After restoring Kay's memory, the two remaining Men in Black set out to conquer Serleena with a motley band of friendly aliens, including a handful of worm creatures and a talking dog named Frank (voice of Tim Blaney). Jay, meanwhile, has his head turned by Laura (Rosario Dawson), an attractive waitress who was an unwitting witness to an alien attack. Men in Black 2 also features Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub, David Cross, Patrick Warburton, and Johnny Knoxville. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Barry Sonnenfeld;Barry Fanaro,Robert Gordon;/celebrity/barry_fanaro,/celebrity/;as Agent K,as Agent J,as Laura Vasquez,as Serleena,as Scrad/Charlie,as Zed,as Jack Jeebs,as Agent T,as Ben,as Newton,as Hailey,as Motorman,as Man With Dog,as Creepy,as New York Guy,as New York Guy,as MIB Guard,as Agent,as Agent,as Repairman Agent,as MIB Agent,as MIB Customs Agent,as MIB Customs Agent,as MIB Customs Agent,as MIB Passport Control Agent,as Herself,as Agent M,as Agent Gee,as Agent C,as MIB Autopsy Agent,as Central Park Agent,as Bird Guy Alien/Postal-Sorting Alien,as Bird Lady Alien,as Family Child Alien,as Jarra/Family Dad Alien,as Family Mom/Locker Alien,as Young Postal Employee,as Young Girl At Post Office,as Split Alien Guy,as Eye Guy,as Joey,as Himself,as Ambassador Lauranna,as `Mysteries in History' Lauranna,as Neuralyzed Mother,as Neuralyzed Father,as Neuralyzed Daughter,as Corn Face,as Flesh Balls,as Pineal Eye,as Mosh Tendrils,as Postman,as Diner Guy,as Gordy;Men in Black II;https://resizing.flixster.com/mjNMaFpTwbbNtEX3FGEGBcOrEZw=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2NDU1NDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Matthew Broderick plays Steven, an average Joe who is forlorn over his recent breakup with girlfriend Robin (Leslie Mann). When he moves into a new apartment, Steven comes in contact with Chip, who shows up to hook up the cable. Before he knows it, and whether he likes it or not, Steven has a new best-friend in the obnoxious and clingy Chip. However, Steven soon learns that obnoxious is a walk in the park compared to Chip's behavior when Steven tells him he doesn't want to be his pal anymore. What's worse, no one -- including Robin or his family -- believes Steven when he accuses the seemingly harmless Chip of being a malevolent menace.

Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fiancÃƒÂ©e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;Simon Wells,Gore Verbinski;John Logan;/celebrity/john_logan;as Alexander Hartdegen,as Mara,as ÃƒÅ“ber-Morlock,as Vox,as Toren,as Dr. Philby,as Emma,as Mrs. Watchit,as Robber,as Flower Shop Worker,as Jogger,as Soldier #1,as Kalen,as Teacher,as Motorist,as Flower Seller,as Fifth Avenue Carriage Driver,as Central Park Carriage Driver,as Soldier #1,as Soldier #2,as Hunter Morlock,as Eloi,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Hunter Morlock,as Spy Morlock,as Spy Morlock,as Spy Morlock,as Spy Morlock,as Spy Morlock,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Fifth Avenue Carriage Driver,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,as Eloi,,;The Time Machine;https://resizing.flixster.com/EHnEGogpJaXpcd8grU_8dbAGmbY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTI5MDI1NTtqOzE3NTQ1OzEyMDA7MTIwMDsxNjAw

Although it's been years since he was back, Henry Hart, a successful but lonely New York artist, returns to Big Eden, the town of his childhood, to care for the ailing grandfather who raised him. Once home, Henry finds he must come to terms with his relationship to Dean Stewart, his best friend from high school, and the object of his unrequited love. Henry's feelings for Dean, which caused him to flee Big Eden nearly twenty years ago, seem to have only grown stronger over the intervening years. At the same time, Henry's reappearance sparks a transformation in Pike Dexter, the shy, unassuming, Native American owner of the town's general store. Pike is as surprised as anyone, and completely unprepared, when he finds himself falling in love with Henry. As this unspoken triangle unfolds under the scrutiny of Big Eden's community, nearly everyone in town develops a stake in its outcome.;Thomas Pezucha,Thomas Bezucha;Thomas Bezucha;/celebrity/thomas_bezucha;as Henry,as Henry Hart,as Pike,as Dean,as Grace,as Sam,as Widow Thayer,as Jim,as Anna,as Mary,as John,as Andrew,as Ben Stewart,as Becky Rudolph,as Lloyd,as Bird,as Fulbright,as Leon,as Dick,as Wheeler,as Jenny,as Carol,as Didi Soams,as Reverend Alston,as Woman at Church,as Man at Church,as Douglas,as Man at Piano,as Woman in Car No. 1,as Woman in Car No. 2,as Woman in Car No. 3,as Schoolgirl No. 1,as Schoolgirl No. 2,as Schoolgirl No. 3,as Schoolgirl No. 4,as Carl at Gallery,as Julie Bauer,as John Bishop,as Airline Attendant,as Airport Security Man,as Airport Security Woman,as Man in Bar,as Choir Director,as Choir Member No. 1,as Choir Member No. 2,as Choir Member No. 3,as Choir Member No. 4,as Mrs. Stewart,as Mr. Stewart,as Eligible Man,as Eligible Man,as Eligible Man,as Eligible Man,as Eligible Man,as Eligible Man;Big Eden;https://resizing.flixster.com/DE-cW_q428sIh_52XgNO5M25jw0=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTI5MDI1MjtqOzE3NTQ1OzEyMDA7MTUwNjsyMDA4

In the summer of 1969, Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill) leads a team of scientists overseeing the operations of one of the world's largest radio telescope dishes, nestled in a New South Wales community of sheep farmers. As NASA prepares for Apollo 11, the first manned voyage to the moon, Buxton and his crew are asked if they will allow their telescope's dish to be used as a backup receiver for the television transmission from the moon, should the main receiver in California fail. Buxton and his men are more than happy to help, and the village is agog as they gear up for their own small part in one of the world's greatest adventures. Mayor McIntyre (Roy Billing) and his wife May (Genevieve Mooy) are thrilled to be greeting a small but steady stream of important visitors, though many of the locals are not especially good with etiquette, and several members of Buxton's team, most notably high-strung Mitch (Kevin Harrington), are less than enthusiastic about Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton), the know-it-all NASA technician brought in to oversee the Australian operations. When a change in Apollo 11's schedule means the Australian dish will have to pick up the vital broadcast from the moon, Cliff, Mitch, and Al must put aside their differences to pull the show together. Though played for laughs, The Dish was inspired by actual events. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi;Rob Sitch;Santo Cilauro,Rob Sitch,Tom Gleisner,Jane Kennedy;/celebrity/santo_cilauro,/celebrity/rob_sitch,/celebrity/tom_gleisner,/celebrity/jane_kennedy;as Cliff Buxton,as Ross `Mitch' Mitchell,as Al Burnett,as Glenn Latham,as May McIntyre,as Rudi Kellerman,as Mayor Bob McIntyre,as Prime Minister,as Len Purvis,as Marie McIntyre,as Keith Morrison,as Janine Kellerman,as U.S. Ambassador,as Prime Minister,as Billy McIntyre,,as Cameron,as Miss Nolan,as Damien,as Graeme,as Melanie,as Nicholas,as Mr. Callen,as Newspaper Reporter,as Pearl,as Bronwyn,as Ray,as Adrian Hobbs,as Lead Guitarist,as Trumpet Player,as Trombone,as Drummer,as Pianist,as Melva,as Gwen,as Ron,as Journalist,as Camera Person,as Sound Person,as Barry Steele,as Ambassador's Aide,as Reverend Loftus,as ABC TV Newsreader,as Betty the Bush Poet,as Female Print Journalist,as Male Reporter,as TV Scientist;The Dish;https://resizing.flixster.com/H0zqBhIk-QIVfuScRFYnrERZvV0=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTI5MDI0OTtqOzE3NTQ1OzEyMDA7MTMzMjsxNzc2

Based on the speculative novel by Joe Gores, the story concerns real-life detective novelist Dashiell Hammett (Frederic Forest), who early in his career is involved in a complex mystery that will profoundly influence his later works. While hacking away for pulp magazines, Hammett is asked by Jimmy Ryan (Peter Boyle), his old boss at the Pinkerton agency (and the model for the writer's ""Continental Op"" character), to help out on a particularly difficult case. Before long, Hammett is prowling the nooks and crannies of San Francisco in search of a missing Chinese prostitute-blackmailer (Lydia Lei). Among the several delectable ""inside jokes"" in Hammett is the presence of Elisha Cook, who'd appeared in the 1941 film adaptation of Hammett's Maltese Falcon, as Eli the Cab Driver. Cinematographers Philip H. Lathrop and Joseph Biroc work overtime to invest Hammett with the ""feel"" of a classic 1940s detective yarn.";Wim Wenders;Wim Wenders,George More O'Ferrall,Thomas Pope,Ross Thomas;/celebrity/wim_wenders,/celebrity/george-more-oferrall,/celebrity/thomas_pope,/celebrity/ross_thomas;as Hammett,as Jimmy Ryan,as Kit Conger/Sue Alabama,as English Eddie Hagedorn,as Eli, the Taxi Driver,as Crystal Ling,as Lt.

Johnny has nowhere to turn, and because gangsters tend to flourish in his neighborhood he goes to work for Dundee, a benevolent godfather-gangster type, in order to cover his mother's medical bills. Johnny hides his association with Dundee from his younger brother Tommy (Griffin Dunne) and goes so far as to pay for Tommy's law school fees -- supporting him until Tommy joins the staff of the local (and corrupt) district attorney's office for Burr (Danny DeVito). When Johnny starts working for Dundee, he clashes with the evil Vermin (Joe Piscopo) right from the beginning, but things only get worse. After Dundee decides to retire, Johnny ascends to the helm, and it does not look like Vermin is going to take that sitting down.;Amy Heckerling;Harry Colomby,Lorenzo Semple Jr.,Norman Steinberg;/celebrity/harry_colomby,/celebrity/lorenzo_semple_jr,/celebrity/norman_steinberg_6;as Johnny Kelly/Johnny Dangerously,as Danny Vermin,as Lil,as Ma Kelly,as Dundee,as Tommy,as Sally,as The Pope,as Maroni,as Burr,as Pat,as Vendor,as Arthur,,,as Young Johnny,as Desk Sergeant,as Charley,as Cleaning Woman,as Dutch,as Manny,as Vito,as Mayor,as Tony Scarano,as Boy in Suit,as Young Vermin,as Mrs. Capone,as Girl on Steps,as Woman,as Prisoner,as Prisoner,as Young Tommy,as Prisoner,as Blond Girl,as Reporter Duffy,as Henchman,as Photographer,as Dr. Zillman,as Porter,as Woman,as Reporter Diering,as Hood,as Photographer,as Priest,as Chorus Girl,as Judge,as Dr. Magnus,as Mrs. Zimmer,as Policeman,as T-Shirt Vendor,as Prisoner Rabbi,as Governor,as Emcee,as Prisoner,as Prisoner,as Man,as Prisoner,as Warden,as Female Butler,as Girl;Johnny Dangerously;https://resizing.flixster.com/bR06nVc26NieR3Esj2BumNeo-Mg=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDMwNztqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7NzY4OzEwMjQ

The film follows 17-year-old Ritchie as he strolls from one end of his California barrio to the other, guitar in hand. We meet Ritchie's colorful Mexican/American family, who react to his fame with varying degrees of pride and envy. And we meet the ladies in his life: his ambitious mother Connie Valenzuela (Rosana De Soto), his half-sister Rosie Morales (Elizabeth Pena), and blonde classmate Donna Ludwig (Danielle von Zerneck), who inspired Ritchie's first hit ""Donna."" Both this song and ""La Bamba"" are given con brio interpretations by Lou Diamond Philips and by the contemporary group Los Lobos, who appear in the film as the Tijuana band. Also making cameo appearances are the real-life Mrs. Connie Valenzuela and Bob Morales, Richie's half- brother (played in the film by Esai Morales). Those familiar with The Buddy Holly Story (1978) don't need to be reminded what happens after Ritchie, Holly (Marshall Crenshaw) and The Big Bopper board that plane on February 3, 1959.

When she's fired from her job at an upscale law firm for voicing her stance against the testing of cosmetics on animals, Elle heads to Capitol Hill to fight for her cause before Congress, leaving her boyfriend, Emmett (Luke Wilson, reprising his role from the film's predecessor), behind. Once there, she runs into plenty of adversity and red-tape and can't seem to find anyone who will listen to her proposals. While staying at the Watergate hotel though, she meets and befriends an elderly bellman (Bob Newhart in his first theatrical role since 1997's In & Out) who's been around politicians long enough to know the ins and outs of the political machine. With his help, Elle attempts to convince disillusioned U.S. Representative Rudd (Sally Field) to help her get her voice heard in front of the stodgy old coots of the legislative branch. Directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld hot off the success of his critically acclaimed indie comedy Kissing Jessica Stein, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde boasts a supporting cast led by Jennifer Coolidge (Best in Show, American Pie) and Regina King (Jerry Maguire, Daddy Day Care). ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi;Charles Herman-Wurmfeld;Eve Ahlert,Dennis Drake,Kate Kondell;/celebrity/eve_ahlert,/celebrity/1148052-dennis_drake,/celebrity/kate_kondell;as Elle Woods,as Rep.

While out scouting for talent at a Milonga bar, Mario is introduced to Angelo Larroca, a gangster and financier of Mario's film. Angelo asks Mario to audition his mistress, Elena, a gifted and stunning young dancer. Mario and Elena become entangled in a passionate and dangerous love affair.

What would it be? For John Sullivan, there is no question. He would undo the events of October 12, 1969, when the out-of-control Bruxton fire took the life of his father, a heroic firefighter. Ever since he was a kid, John dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day, which set into motion the anger and loneliness that have haunted his adult life as a cop in the 1990s. Now John may get exactly what he has wished for, and more than he bargained for. One day before the anniversary of his father's death, in the midst of the spectacular storm known as the aurora borealis, John Sullivan discovers in the house he inherited his father's old ham radio and begins to play with it. Through the electrical static, he finds himself talking to a man who claims to be a firefighter and who appears to be awaiting the World Series of 1969. Is John really talking to his own living father on the very same day, in the very same house, but exactly three decades ago? At first neither can believe it, but soon John is carrying on an all-night conversation with his young father, sharing for the first time his deep love and regret over his future death. Yet John realizes that now he may be able to change all that. By alerting Frank to the mistake that cost him his life the first time around, John saves his youthful father from dying in the Bruxton fire. On October 12, 1999, John Sullivan discovers that he now has photographs on his walls of his father as a gray-haired man. By changing the past, the Sullivans have forged a new present. John is ecstatic with his new memories of his father- until he discovers other things have been altered. Subtle changes caused by his father's survival have led to a string of unsolved serial homicides, including the grisly murder of John's mother. Now Frank and John must race against the clock-divided by three decades and connected only by a radio-to prevent a murder that will seal their destinies. And each time Frank changes something in his universe, John wakes up to a whole new reality.;Gregory Hoblit;Toby Emmerich;/celebrity/toby_emmerich;as Frank Sullivan,as Jack Shepard,as Satch DeLeon,as Julia Sullivan,as Gordo Hersch,as Samantha Thomas,as Johnny Sullivan (age 6),as Graham Gibson,as Gordo Hersch (age 8),as Commander O'Connell,as Butch Foster,as John Sullivan,as Gordie Jr. (age 10),as Sissy Clark,as Chuck Hayes,as Fred Shepard,as Laura Shepard,as Teenage Runaway,as Carrie Reynolds,as Daryl Adams,as Mrs. Finelli,as Himself,as Himself,as Linda Hersch,as Con Ed Supervisor,as Con Ed Worker No. 1,as Con Ed Worker No. 2,as Stoned Teenage Girl,as Young Intern,as Lounge Bartender,as Roof Man Billy,as Pedestal Man Gino,as Lanni DeLeon,as Desk Sergeant,as Stoned Man No. 1,as Cozy Bartender,as Young Woman No. 1,as Young Woman No. 2,as Forensic Tech Hector,as Uniformed Cop No. 1,as Uniformed Cop No. 2,as Bar Waitress,as Frank Jr.;Frequency;https://resizing.flixster.com/Z0BzEyUEGxu0FrpV7BB2CFbG1Dc=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDMzMTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Michael J. Fox is the voice of Milo Thatch, a lowly museum employee and linguist in the early 20th century who's determined to continue his late grandfather's search for the lost, sunken empire of Atlantis. Bankrolled by eccentric millionaire Preston Whitmore (John Mahoney), Milo teams up with a diverse crew of mercenaries led by submarine commander Rourke (James Garner). After a sea battle with a giant denizen of the deep, the explorers locate the submerged civilization. Milo falls in love with Princess Kida (Cree Summer), the daughter of Atlantis' aged ruler (Leonard Nimoy), and must choose sides when it's revealed that some of his fellow expedition members intend to steal a mystical energy source from their hosts. Claudia Christian, Mark Hamill, David Ogden Stiers, Don Novello, and the late Jim Varney co-star. Although considered a shoo-in for a nomination in the debut year of the new Oscar category of Best Animated Feature, Atlantis: The Lost Empire faced stiff competition from other non-live-action entertainment in the summer of 2001, including Shrek, Final Fantasy, and Monsters Inc..;Gary Trousdale,Kirk Wise;Gary Trousdale,Joss Whedon,Kirk Wise,Tab Murphy,Bruce Zabel,Jackie Zabel;/celebrity/gary_trousdale_8,/celebrity/1060778-joss_whedon,/celebrity/kirk_wise_4,/celebrity/tab_murphy,/celebrity/bruce_zabel,/celebrity/jackie_zabel;as Milo Thatch,as Cdr.

Gerard has been assigned to escort a federal prisoner to a maximum security prison in Missouri. On the same flight is Mark Sheridan (Wesley Snipes), who has been arrested and charged with the murders of two Federal agents, though he insists he's innocent. The plane is involved in an accident leading to a crash, and after helping to rescue some of the passengers, Sheridan escapes. The State Department informs Gerard that finding Sheridan and putting him back behind bars is a top priority, and Gerard sets out on his trail, with the very much uncalled-for assistance of eccentric FBI agent John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.). However, Gerard soon begins to wonder just how Sheridan became such an important man in the eyes of the government, while Sheridan is determined to find out who turned him in to the authorities. U.S. Marshals also features Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, and Kate Nelligan. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi;Stuart Baird;Roy Huggins,John Pogue;/celebrity/roy_huggins_5,/celebrity/john_pogue;as Chief Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard,as Mark Sheridan,as John Royce,as U.S. Marshal Walsh,as Deputy Marshal Cosmo Renfro,as Marie,as Biggs,as Cooper,as Chen,as Lamb,as Frank Barrows,as Jimmy,as Deputy Marshal Henry,as Detective Kim,as Deputy Jackson,as Distracted Driver,as Young Cop,as Fireman,as Female Cop,as Hospital Cashier,as Desk Sergeant,as Greg Conroy,as Mike Conroy,as Mama Conroy,as Greg's Girlfriend,as Stacia Vela,as Detective Caldwell,as Deputy Hollander,as Deputy Stern,as 727 Prisoner,as Ling,as 1st 727 Deputy,as 727 Pilot,as Sheriff Poe,as 1st Cop,as Trooper with Dogs,as Earl,as Martha,as Roadblock Trooper,as State Trooper Captain,as Tracker,as Royce's Guide,as Kidnapped Man,as Donna,as Stark,as Undercover Deputy,as Minister,as Deputy Holt,as Doorman,as Janitor,as Saks Saleswoman,as Man in Green Cap,as Network Reporter,as Drugstore Clerk,as Ship's First Officer,as Prosecutor,as Caldwell's Wife,as New York Reporter,as Swamp Tracker,as 4th Reporter,as Chicago Nurse,as New York Paramedic,as New York Paramedic,as Elderly Resident,as Elderly Resident,as 10th Deputy,as 6th Deputy,as 727 Co-pilot,as 727 Navigator,as NTSB Agent,as Newman's Guide,as Detective,as Detective,as Royce's Guide,as Mike's Girlfriend,as Bartender,as 3rd Reporter,as Man in Taxi,as Reporter,as Bar Patron;U.S. Marshals;https://resizing.flixster.com/tK7RFRLQ1ulrbLl26_emCBy45nA=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2OTc3MDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

The story is as basic as space operas get: Ming (Max von Sydow) has developed a plan to destroy the Earth, and Flash (Sam J. Jones) and his attractive companion, Dale Arden (Melody Anderson), are called upon to stop him. Along the way, Flash must battle Ming's goons and the temptations of a luscious space princess. Previously the basis for a more straight-faced 1930s adventure serial, Flash's story is mined here for exaggerated, cartoon humor by screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr., a central figure in the similarly campy '60s Batman television series. The simplistic plot mainly serves as an excuse for spectacular sets and cartoonish action sequences, all set to an appropriately over-the-top rock score by Queen. Certainly not a film to turn to for serious excitement, fine performances, or character development, Flash Gordon has nevertheless developed an appreciative cult of fans who admire the film's humorous approach and the detailed, colorful production design.;Mike Hodges;Lorenzo Semple Jr.,Michael Allin;/celebrity/lorenzo_semple_jr,/celebrity/michael_allin;as Flash Gordon,as Dale Arden,as Flash Gordon,as Dr. Hans Zarkov,as The Emperor Ming, Ming's Floating Servant,as Aura,as Prince Barin,as Prince Vultan,as Klytus,as Kala,as Arborian Priest,as Fico,as Luro,as Zogi, the High Priest,as Serving Girl,as Munson,as Hedonia,as Biro,as Vultan's Daughter,as Mongon Doctor,,as Airline Pilot,as Airline Pilot,as Man at Airport,as Young Treeman,as Treeman,,as Hawkwoman,as Hawkwoman,as Wounded Hawkman,as Klytus' Pilot,as Klytus' Observer,as Ming's Officer,as Colonel in Battle Control Room,as Battle Room Controller,,as Captain of Ming's Air Force,as Princess Aura's Pet,as Queen of Azuria,as Queen of Frigia,as King of Frigia,as Prince of Ardentia,as Frigian Girl,as Hawkman,,as Hawkman,as Hawkman,as Hawkman,as Hawkman,as Hawkman,as Hawkman,as Hawkman,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Azurdian Man,as Ardentian Man,as Ardentian Man,as Ardentian Man,as Ardentian Man,as Ardentian Man,as Ming's Serving Girl,as Ming's Serving Girl,as Ming's Serving Girl,as Ming's Serving Girl,as Sandmoon Girl,as Sandmoon Girl,as Sandmoon Girl,as Sandmoon Girl,as Aquarian Girl,as Aquarian Girl,as Aquarian Girl,as Aquarian Girl,as Ming's Exotic Girl,as Ming's Exotic Girl,as Ming's Exotic Girl,as Ming's Brute,as Ming's Brute,as Ming's Brute,as Ming's Brute,as Ming's Brute,as Ming's Brute,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Dwarf,as Special Movement,as Special Movement,as Special Movement,as Special Movement,as Special Movement,as Special Movement,as Special Movement,;Flash Gordon;https://resizing.flixster.com/CbNWL3VglFUF3-Q__CRlmJTmLjY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDMzNTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Screenwriter Todd Robinson wrote the script after meeting one of the tragedy's survivors, Chuck Gieg. In the film, Gieg (Scott Wolf) is the narrator. He and his fellow students, whose parents have paid handsomely for their schooling, which combines classroom work with real-life adventure, are introduced to their grizzled seafaring captain, Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges). Gieg is initially skeptical of Sheldon's authority, but he gradually comes to see the captain as a model of manhood. The other boys aboard include Frank Beaumont (Jeremy Sisto), a self-absorbed snob; Dean Preston (Eric Michael Cole), a troublemaker and bully; Tod Johnston (Balthazar Getty), a returning student; and the naÃƒÂ¯ve Tracy Lapchick (Ethan Embry). John Savage plays the pompous English teacher aboard the ship. Various incidents establish the boys' insecurities and relationships with the authorities -- and foreshadow their eventual fate. The killer squall comes up quietly but soon turns deadly, and the boys are forced to go beyond their privileged upbringings and deal with real danger. ~ Michael Betzold, Rovi";Ridley Scott;Todd Robinson;/celebrity/todd_robinson;as Christopher Sheldon,as Dr. Alice Sheldon,as McCrea,as Chuck Gieg,as Frank Beaumont,as Tod Johnstone,as Tracy Lapchick,as Gil Martin,as Robert March,as Dean Preston,as Girard Pascal,as Shay Jennings,as Francis Beaumont,as Sanders,as Charles Gieg,as Middy Gieg,as Peggy Beaumont,as Cuban Commander,as Tyler,as Girl In Brothel,as Ms. Boyde,as Bregitta,as Relief Bo'sun,as Crew Member,as Crew Member,as Crew Member,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl,as Danish Schoolgirl;White Squall;https://resizing.flixster.com/EUT8oFWRRrdwlWkRCkC5ddLivlI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIyNzA2MDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MjEwMDsyODAw

Though it drew its name from the familiar television series, director Brian DePalma's big-budget adaptation shares little more with the original show than the occasional self-destructing message and the name of team leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight). The film focuses not on Phelps but his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, Ethan Hunt (a reserved Tom Cruise), who becomes a fugitive after taking the blame for a botched operation. He responds by banding together with a group of fellow renegades, and he is soon maneuvering his way through a twisted series of double crosses that mainly serve as excuses for spectacular high-tech action sequences.

When a murder occurs at a secluded Benedictine Abbey, William is called in to investigate. As he and his apprentice, Adson von Melk (Christian Slater), delve deeper and deeper into the case, more dead bodies begin to turn up. Eventually, Bernardo Gui, an inquisitor played by F. Murray Abraham gets involved, but he may not have the best intentions.

The titular outlaw bunch, headed by ethical-in-his-fashion Pike (William Holden), continues staging violent bank robberies in their old, time-honored tradition. After a particularly brutal holdup in the town of San Rafael, the gang -- or what's left of it -- heads for the hills of Mexico, pursued by a posse led by Thornton (Robert Ryan), an old friend of Pike's. The gang discovers that the bank had been set up to be robbed by Thornton's railroad-executive boss Pat Harrigan (Albert Dekker), and that their booty consists of worthless metal washers. Meanwhile, the conscience-stricken Thornton seethes over Harrigan's scheme, which has cost too many innocent lives, but he is powerless to leave the railroad baron's employ lest he be sent back to jail. While hiding out in a Mexican village, the gang is engaged by corrupt general Emilio Fernandez to steal a huge shipment of guns from the U.S. Army. Like Thornton, Pike agrees against his will: his right-hand man Jaime Sanchez is being held hostage by Fernandez, who in turn is being manipulated by a pair of war-mongering German officers. More violence -- both justified and gratuitous -- follows, leading to a final blood-spattered confrontation between the Wild Bunch and 's posse. For many years, no one audience was privy to a ""definitive"" version of The Wild Bunch. Peckinpah's 144-minute director's cut was butchered by Warner Bros. after its first press showing (curiously, the studio removed not only the gorier scenes, but also several motivational sequences, rendering much of the film incomprehensible). The 1981 reissue was restored to 141 minutes, but it wasn't until the advent of home video that the complete version was once more made available. Once considered the last word in cinematic bloodletting, The Wild Bunch is a model of decorum compared to what was to follow.";Sam Peckinpah;Sam Peckinpah,Walon Green,Roy N.

Playing crazy to avoid prison work detail, manic free spirit Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is sent to the state mental hospital for evaluation. There he encounters a motley crew of mostly voluntary inmates, including cowed mama's boy Billy (Brad Dourif) and silent Native American Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), presided over by the icy Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Ratched and McMurphy recognize that each is the other's worst enemy: an authority figure who equates sanity with correct behavior, and a misfit who is charismatic enough to dismantle the system simply by living as he pleases. McMurphy proceeds to instigate group insurrections large and small, ranging from a restorative basketball game to an unfettered afternoon boat trip and a tragic after-hours party with hookers and booze. Nurse Ratched, however, has the machinery of power on her side to ensure that McMurphy will not defeat her. Still, McMurphy's message to live free or die is ultimately not lost on one inmate, revealing that escape is still possible even from the most oppressive conditions. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi;Milos Forman;Bo Goldman,Lawrence Hauben;/celebrity/bo_goldman,/celebrity/1061468-lawrence_hauben;as Randle McMurphy,as Nurse Ratched,as Harding,as Chief Bromden,as Martini,as Taber,as Billy Bibbit,as Ellis,as Col.

This installment opens with Jamie Lloyd (J.C. Brandy), young niece of supernatural psycho-killer Michael Myers, giving birth on an altar amid a mysterious Druid ceremony. Before she is killed by her monstrous uncle, Jamie manages to leave her baby in the care of young Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), who has pursued a lifelong obsession with the horrific Myers family legacy in the town of Haddonfield, IL. Living with members of the Strode family, Tommy comes to suspect that one of them, little Danny Strode (Devin Gardner), is cursed with the same malevolent power that drove Michael to murder several members of his family. When Michael arrives in Haddonfield to find and destroy Jamie's baby, Tommy joins forces with Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Michael's ex-psychiatrist and a life-long crusader against his sinister former patient, to find the connection between Michael and the Man in Black and end the curse once and for all. Released shortly after Pleasence's death, this confusing, horribly edited blend of tired slasher clichÃƒÂ©s and X-Files-inspired subplots is a poor testament to the long career of the distinguished and compelling character actor. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi;Joe Chappelle;Daniel Farrands;/celebrity/daniel_farrands;as Dr. Sam Loomis,as Tommy Doyle,as Wynn,as Kara Strode,as Michael Myers,as Debra Strode,as John Strode,as Tim Strode,as Beth,as Beth,as Danny Strode,as Barry Simms,as Motorist,,as Mary;Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers (Halloween 6);https://resizing.flixster.com/w4emhfrV1TmPAic_wGnis1nV924=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDc2NztqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7NzY4OzEwMjQ

Nicolas Cage stars as Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons expert handed a unique assignment. Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris), an insane Marine Corps general, has taken 81 tourists hostage on the abandoned island prison of Alcatraz. He and his men are threatening to bomb San Francisco with deadly gas unless $100 million is paid in war reparations to the families of servicemen killed in covert operations. Goodspeed is teamed with former British spy John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man ever to escape ""The Rock,"" as well as a Navy SEAL team. When their military escorts are ambushed, it's up to odd couple Goodspeed and Mason to break into Alcatraz and stop Hummel. The Rock was the last film produced by Simpson, who died of a drug overdose before the film's release. Solo, his partner Bruckheimer continued making the sort of glossy, frenetic films for which the duo was famed. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Michael Bay;David Weisberg,Douglas S.

Tom (Scott Speedman of TV's Felicity) approaches Dan (James Marsden of X-Men) in a bar, and the two hit it off. Tom brings Dan home to his apartment, where, after some idle chatter, Dan tries to kiss Tom. Tom shies away, and begins asking Dan about his sexual history. Dan eventually realizes that he's been in Tom's apartment before. They had an encounter several years ago, and Tom has a much clearer memory of that night than Dan does. Eventually, things turn ugly, and Dan finds himself tied to a chair. Tom extracts a blood sample, explaining to Dan that he just recently learned that he's HIV-positive. Tom insists that he's not gay, and believes that the only way he could have gotten the virus is from Dan. Tom goes out to have the blood sample tested, and when he gets back, he tells Dan that when he gets the results back, if Dan is HIV-positive, Tom is going to kill him. As they wait for the results, the hours go by, and Dan tries to engage Tom in conversation, to engage his sympathy, and to find a way to escape. As the two men talk and battle for control, Piccirillo flashes back to the recent past, and Tom's motives become more clear.

Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) is the head of the LAPD and is loyal to his officers and eager to turn a blind eye to violence or corruption within his department, as long as it's the ""bad guys"" who are getting hurt. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a police detective whose violent and cynical nature is often at war with his basic sense of decency and justice. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is a beat cop-turned-detective whose strict by-the-book philosophy and willingness to blow the whistle on other officers is balanced by a shrewd and opportunistic understanding of the internal politics of the department. And Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a flashy ""Hollywood"" detective who serves as technical advisor for the TV series Badge of Honor. He is also in cahoots with Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito), publisher of the scandal sheet Hush Hush, who throws kickbacks to Vincennes in exchange for being brought along when showbiz figures get busted. White, Exley, and Vincennes find themselves drawn into a tangled and sticky web of violence and betrayal following a multiple murder at a coffee shop that is believed to be part of an effort by Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle) to consolidate his hold on organized crime in L.A. This lead appears to be connected to the discovery of a bizarre pornography and call-girl ring operated by Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose women are given plastic surgery so that they more closely resemble well-known movie stars. White's role in the investigation is complicated when he falls for Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), one of Patchett's prostitutes, who is the spitting image of Veronica Lake. L.A. Confidential was nominated for nine Academy Awards and netted two, with Brian Helgeland honored for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Kim Basinger taking home a statuette as Best Supporting Actress. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Curtis Hanson;Curtis Hanson,Brian Helgeland;/celebrity/curtis_hanson,/celebrity/brian_helgeland;as Bud White,as Jack Vincennes,as Ed Exley,as Dudley Smith,as Pierce Patchett,as Lynn Bracken,as Dick Stensland,as Matt Reynolds,as Brett Chase,as Police Chief,as Mickey Cohen,as D.A.

In 1961, the house is home to Edith (Vanessa Redgrave) and Abby (Marian Seldes), an elderly lesbian couple whose lifestyle is not accepted or acknowledged by their families. When Abby suffers a serious stroke and is on the verge of death, her family rallies to her side, but not understanding the nature of her relationship with Edith, she is not included as her loved ones say their final good-byes. After Abby's death, her nephew (Paul Giamatti) and his wife (Elizabeth Perkins) arrive from out of state with plans to sell the house, without consulting Edith. In 1972, the house is now home to four college students, Michelle (Amy Carlson), Linda (Michelle Williams), Karen (Nia Long), and Jeanne (Natasha Lyonne), all of whom are actively involved in the women's movement and also happen to be lesbians. The four find themselves at odds with the campus women's group when they try to promote an all-women's dance, while the other members of the group feel that feminism, not lesbianism, should be the focus of the group. Similarly, Linda faces hostility from her friends when she becomes involved with Amy (Chloe Sevigny), a very butch townie; Linda's friends see Amy's masculine attire and attitude as a form of self-loathing against being a woman, and while Linda cares deeply for Amy, she's not always comfortable with her and isn't sure that she wants to be public with their relationship. In 2000, Fran (Sharon Stone) and Kal (Ellen DeGeneres), a happy and firmly committed couple, are sharing the house, and after much discussion, they decide that they want to take their relationship to the next level and have a baby. However, deciding that they want a child and dealing with the practicalities of getting pregnant are two different things; Fran and Kal first debate about going to a sperm bank as opposed to asking one of their male friends to help out, and later, either going to a doctor to perform the procedure or trying it at home. DeGeneres' significant other, Anne Heche, wrote and directed the final segment; the 1972 story was directed by Martha Coolidge, and the 1961 episode was directed by Jane Anderson.";Jane Anderson,Martha Coolidge,Anne Heche;Alex Sichel,Anne Heche,Jane Anderson,Sylvia Sichel;/celebrity/alex_sichel_3,/celebrity/anne_heche,/celebrity/jane_anderson,/celebrity/sylvia_sichel;as Kal,as Ted,as Karen,as Edith,as Fran,as Amy,,as Abby,as Alice,as Linda,as Jeanne,as Michelle,as Tom,as Arnold,as Alfie,as Doctor,,as Diane,as Marge,,,,;If These Walls Could Talk 2;https://resizing.flixster.com/_4QPavljDCa4xEgabmnDfbV-XNM=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDc2NjtqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7NDk1OzY2MA

At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award.

With brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), he arrives in Tombstone, Arizona intending to build his fortune. He discovers that long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) is there and that the town is run by a group of brutal outlaws called the Cowboys. Earp, frustrated with his laudanum-addicted wife, begins a romance with traveling stage actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). Meanwhile, the Cowboys terrorize the citizens of Tombstone unchecked. When the town marshal is killed by a Cowboy, Earp steps in to prevent a lynching by an angry mob. He also refuses to hand the killer over to his fellows, beginning the enmity between the Cowboys and the Earp brothers. Virgil, overcome with guilt at doing nothing to help the Tombstone citizens, accepts the position of town marshal. With Wyatt and Morgan as his deputies, and the help of Doc, Virgil attempts to arrest several Cowboys, resulting in the famous OK Corral shoot-out. The Cowboys take revenge by ambushing two of the brothers and injuring Virgil and killing Morgan. The Earps leave town, apparently cowed. Wyatt returns, wearing the badge of a U.S. marshal, vowing to destroy every last Cowboy. He hunts them mercilessly, until the leader, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) challenges Wyatt to a duel. While not regarded as an artistic masterpiece, ""Tombstone"" is considered the best of director George P. Cosmatos' prolific films. The all-star cast (including Thomas Haden Church and Billy Bob Thornton in small roles) delivers solid performances. Both William A. Fraker's cinematography and Bruce Broughton's stirring musical score are expertly designed for dramatic effect. Blood is shown liberally in several key scenes, but seems intended to show that there is nothing glorious in Wyatt Earp's actions, only necessity.

Cofi bravely rises to the occasion, but the dog's success in the ring leads to a violent altercation. Elsewhere, Daniel, a successful publishing magnate, leaves his family to take up with a beautiful model, Valeria. Valeria, however, soon loses a leg in an auto accident, and as Daniel tends to her needs, her tiny pet dog gets trapped under the floorboards of their apartment. And finally, El Chivo (Emilio Echeverria) is an elderly homeless man who is trying to contact his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years. Desperate for money, El Chivo is hired by a businessman to assassinate his partner; however, as he's following his target, he's interrupted by an auto accident, from which Octavio and his injured dog stagger in search of help.

When a stranger calls to ask, ""Have you checked the children lately?"" teenaged sitter Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) is understandably spooked. After a series of increasingly creepy calls culminates in a request for ""your blood...all over me,"" Jill learns from the police operator that the man is calling from inside the house. One narrow escape and two dead children later, the police capture British maniac Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley). Several years later, the killer escapes from a mental institution and plagues Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst), a hard-drinking New Yorker. Foiled by John Clifford (Charles Durning), the same cop who investigated the original case, Duncan sets his sights back on his original victim, Jill Johnson, who, now married and out to dinner with her husband, has left her own young children at home -- with a baby-sitter.

While Cliff is aware of the fact he's gay and has a ravenous curiosity about sex, he hasn't been able to do much about it. However, on his 18h birthday, Cliff's free-thinking mother, Madge (Marnie McPhail), pours him a stiff drink, offers him a reefer, and politely but firmly tells him to go downtown and have some fun. Eager to lose his virginity, Cliff instead encounters Butch (Brendan Fehr), a good-looking guy in his early twenties who makes his living as a male prostitute. Cliff is infatuated with Butch from the first moment he sees him; however, while Butch appears fond of Cliff and strikes up a friendship with him, his career has forced him to develop a sense of emotional distance from others, and he isn't interested in sex with other men unless he's being paid for it. Cliff becomes a regular visitor to Butch's apartment and gets a crash course in the underbelly of the Toronto gay community, but one day Butch drafts Cliff into performing a sex act with him for a customer, leaving Cliff humiliated and heartbroken.

Farmer Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) was born and raised in South Carolina, and fought bravely during the French-Indian wars. But since the death of his wife, Benjamin has renounced violence and quietly tends his crops, raising his seven children alone. In 1776, over Benjamin's objections, his oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) joins the fight against the British. Gabriel returns from battle seriously wounded, with Lord General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) calling for his arrest. A skirmish breaks out on Benjamin's plantation, and one of his children is killed as Gabriel is captured by Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs) and sentenced to hang. Benjamin sets aside his vow of pacifism and rescues Gabriel; with the help of his former comrade-in-arms Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper), the father and son form a regiment of Carolina patriots whose cunning and ruthlessness make them heroes among the colonists -- and wanted men by British troops. Loosely adapted from the true story of Francis Marion and filmed on location in South Carolina, The Patriot was the first feature film made with the cooperation of the Smithsonian Institute, who advised the producers on historical accuracy.

Leo informs Caspar that Bernie pays for protection and is not to be touched. After the Italians leave in a huff, Tom informs Leo that he should give up Bernie.

In an attempt to ferret out the meaning of these flukes, he consults Bernard and Vivian Jaffe, AKA the Existential Detectives, a pair of married metaphysicians who fearlessly investigate the mysteries at the core of their clients' secret innermost lives. Bernard and Vivian kick off their existential exploration of Albert Markovski by probing his past and present reality. Along the way, they uncover his festering conflict with Brad Stand, a golden boy executive climbing the corporate ladder at Huckabees, a popular chain of retail super-stores that wants to sponsor Albert's Open Spaces Coalition for the PR value. The Existential Detectives are convinced that Brad (seemingly Albert's opposite) is the key to cracking Albert's case, but then Brad turns the tables on their investigation, by hiring the detectives himself. As Bernard and Vivian begin to dig deeper into Brad's ambition and his relationship with Huckabees' hot blonde spokes model Dawn, Albert begins to lose faith and rebels against their conclusions. Pairing up with another of the duo's clients--firefighter, tough guy and uncompromising soul searcher Tommy--he joins forces with the Jaffes' arch nemesis, the sexy French philosopher Caterine Vauban, who valiantly battles for the contrasting point of view.

Murphy's regal father (James Earl Jones) agrees to allow the prince 40 days to roam the U.S., sending the prince's faithful retainer Semmi (Arsenio Hall) along to make sure nothing untoward happens. To avoid fortune hunters, Prince Akeem conceals his true identity and gets a ""Joe job"" at a fast-food restaurant. Murphy and Hall play multiple roles, and there are innumerable celebrity cameos peppered throughout the proceedings -- including the Duke Brothers (Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy) from Trading Places. Coming to America made further headlines when humorist Art Buchwald sued the film's producers for plagiarizing one of his works. Buchwald carried the case to trial, where he won a sizeable judgement against the film's producers. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi";John Landis;Barry W.

Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a shy young woman, who, after a brief spell in a mental institution, is released in the care of her overprotective mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and hard-drinking father (Stephen McHattie). Hoping to make good on her own, Lee begins looking for a job, and in her free time indulges in her odd habit of inflicting pain upon herself in various ways. Lee is hired as a secretary by E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a grim and ruthlessly efficient attorney who warns her that her work will be both dull and demanding. Lee takes to the job with genuine enthusiasm, and while she's recently acquired a new boyfriend, Peter (Jeremy Davies), she's far more intrigued by Grey's coldly patrician demeanor. While Grey often criticizes Lee, she seems to thrive on his abuse, but one day he crosses a line when he insists upon spanking her after some minor mistake. Lee quite enjoys the treatment, and wants it to continue, but Grey can no longer take pleasure humiliating Lee when he knows that she likes it; he fires her, despite her pleas to be allowed to stay. Finally discovering the key to her sexual and emotional needs, Lee tries to persuade Peter to be rough with her, but he simply doesn't have the taste or talent for it, and Lee soon maps out a last-ditch effort to win back her position with Grey, whatever the cost. Secretary won a special award for ""Originality"" at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Steven Shainberg;Erin Cressida Wilson,Steven Shainberg;/celebrity/erin_cressida_wilson,/celebrity/steven_shainberg;as Mr. Grey,as Lee,as Peter,as Joan,as Burt,as Dr. Twardon,as Tricia,as Jonathan,as Lee's Sister,as Sylvia,as Stewart,as Allison,as Louisa,as Jessica,as Paralegal,as Paralegal Secretary,as First Secretary,as Typing Teacher,as Mr. Garvey,as First Date,as Second Date,as New Secretary,as TV Reporter;Secretary;https://resizing.flixster.com/y3yCV7My_n1RlTQoIao3DLvuGJQ=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODUzNDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7OTAwOzEyMDA

Stability in Bridget's life, however, quickly becomes a contradiction in terms. Though Mark is openly supportive of Bridget's eccentricities -- and there are many -- she is nonetheless threatened by Mark's young, nubile intern, not to mention irked at finding out that he is, among other less desirable qualities in her eyes, a conservative voter. Complicating issues further is the reentrance of her ex-lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), whom Jones, perhaps mistakenly, thought she had finally gotten over. Before long, the situation escalates into another series of embarrassing circumstances for Bridget, who is faced once again with a crippling feeling of self-doubt and has only her diary and friends to combat it. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi;Beeban Kidron;Andrew Davies,Helen Fielding,Richard Curtis,Adam Brooks;/celebrity/andrew_davies,/celebrity/helen_fielding,/celebrity/richard_curtis,/celebrity/adam_brooks;as Bridget Jones,as Mark Darcy,as Daniel Cleaver,as Dad,as Mum,as Uncle Geoffrey,as Una Alconbury,as Bernard,as Admiral Darcy,as Mrs. Darcy,as Richard Finch,as Jed,as Receptionist,as Mexican Ambassador,as Camilla,as Una,as Production Assistant,as Rebecca,as Shazza,as Tom,as Hamish,as Shirley,as Jude,as Cameraman in Aircraft,as Cameraman in Field,as Girl in Rome,as Janey,as Giles Benwick,as Derek,as Sexy P.A.,as Himself,as Scary Corset Lady,as Hairdresser,as Horatio,as Quizmaster,as Toastmaster,as Commentator,as Chemist,as Chemist Customer,as Chemist Customer,as Chemist Customer,as Homeless Man,as Clive - Man on Plane,as Steward,as Thai Chef,as Thai Prostitute,as Thai Police Woman,as Thai Jail Guard,as Dudwani,as Charlie Parker-Knowles,as Phrao,as Thai Jail Girl,as Thai Jail Girl,as Director in Gallery,as Journalist,as Journalist,as Taxi Driver,as Porter,as Very Old Man,as Mr. Hernandez,as Miss Gallagher,as Man in Corridor,as Vicar;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason;https://resizing.flixster.com/kc8OYKYb5P3_-0IT7jre1-cZJcg=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3ODQ2MztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row ""The Green Mile"" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (David Morse) and Stanton Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged. The Green Mile also stars James Cromwell as the warden; Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene as inmates awaiting dates with the electric chair; and Harry Dean Stanton as a clever trustee. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Frank Darabont;Frank Darabont;/celebrity/frank_darabont;as Paul,as John,as Brutus,as Jan,as Warden,as Delacroix,as Arlen,as Wharton,as Percy,as Dean,as Melinda,as Harry,as Toot-Toot,as Elaine,as Klaus,as Burt,as Orderly Hector,,as Man in Nursing Home,as Lady in Nursing Home,as Old Paul,as Marjorie Detterick,as Howie Detterick,as Kathe Detterick,as Cora Detterick,as Sheriff McGee,as Bill Dodge,as Jack Van Hay,as Cynthia Hammersmith,as Hammersmith's Son,as Hammersmith's Daughter,as Earl the Plumber,as Woman at Del's Execution,as Wife at Del's Execution,as Husband at Del's Execution,as Police Officer,as Reverend at Funeral;The Green Mile;https://resizing.flixster.com/mk5EmoD71Gjvz4BZbawgY5smtTQ=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MDAzMDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Lalit Verma (Naseeruddin Shah) is a wealthy father who is trying to see that his daughter Aditi's wedding goes off without a hitch. Though familiar with Western ways, he has little patience with them and is dead set on seeing the nuptials done properly and traditionally. Disillusioned with her long time relationship with Vikram -- a man who is almost twice her age -- Aditi (Vasundhara Das) suddenly agrees to submit to an arranged marriage with Hemant, an engineer from Houston. Yet as the ceremony nears, she gets cold feet and returns to see her former lover -- even though it could spell disaster for everyone involved.

A breathtaking race against the clock, Run Lola Run straps Tykwers' playfully hip sensibilities to a fun-filled mix of romance, thrills, and action as his tireless heroine pounds the pavement and racks her brain to save her lover from danger. Manni and Lola are twenty-something Berliners, way past cool and desperately in love. When Manni, a local criminal's errand boy, loses twenty thousand Marks, he has twenty minutes to find the money or face retaliation. Not the brightest bulb, Manni turns to the quick-witted, resourceful Lola to devise a plan to save his hide. And so she does, and off she sprints, running for Manni's life, for her love, and to find money somewhere, somehow. Dangling three ""what if"" variations on Lola's mission to save her mate, Run Lola Run propels us toward each outcome with a delicious peppering of surprises, quirks, and twists. A sure-fire hit with audiences, Run Lola Run brings to the screen two actors of immeasurable charisma: Franka Potente as the heroic, flame-haired Lola, and Moritz Bleibtreu as her doltish but devoted lover. Scoring his delirious staccato mix of animation, still photographs, and live action to a pounding techno beat, Tykwer reveals himself a virtuoso of the medium and, at the same time, a passionate believer in destiny and the transcendent power of love.";Tom Tykwer;Tom Tykwer;/celebrity/tom_tykwer;as Lola,as Manni,as Lolas Vater,as Jutta Hansen,as Schuster,as Norbert,as Ronnie,as Mr. Meier,as Mrs. Jager,as Mike,as Doris,,as Kruse, Supermarket Cashier,as Garbageman,as Croupier,as Casino Manager,as Casino Cashier,as Motorman,as Lola's Mother,as Old Woman,as Supermarket Guard,as Policeman,as Narrator;Run Lola Run;https://resizing.flixster.com/GJ6F-q4JDArqNEIT-TwiF5ziGPs=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODUyNztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTU2NjsyMDg4

In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi;Francis Ford Coppola;Mario Puzo,Francis Ford Coppola;/celebrity/mario_puzo,/celebrity/francis_ford_coppola;as Michael Corleone,as Vito Corleone,as Tom Hagen,as Kay,as Connie Corleone,as Fredo Corleone,as Hyman Roth,as Sen.

Neo (Keanu Reeves) remains unconscious in the real world, caught in a mysterious subway station that lies between the machine world and the Matrix, and Bane (Ian Bliss) is still a conduit for Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who continues to grow out of control, threatening to destroy both worlds. Meanwhile, as the sentinels get closer and closer to Zion, the citizens of the earth's last inhabited city prepare for the inevitable onslaught. By bargaining with The Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) are able to free Neo who, after meeting with The Oracle (Mary Alice stepping in for the late Gloria Foster), decides that he must leave Zion and head for the machine mainframe. As Neo and Trinity venture into the dangerous machine world, with hopes of stopping both the machines and Agent Smith, their comrades in Zion attempt to fight off the attacking sentinels with the odds stacked greatly against them.

Linklater, in the style of Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, assumes intelligence on both the part of his characters and his audience, content in his belief that idle conversation between a man and a woman is more of a turn-on than sex. Jess (Ethan Hawke), an American traveling through Europe, meets the French beauty Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train. Jesse is headed to Vienna, where he is flying back to America the next morning. Celine, for her part, is heading off to Paris, where she is starting classes at the Sorbonne. From the moment they catch each other's eye they are immediately attracted to each other. They have a meal in the lounge car and enjoy each other's conversation so much that when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to accompany him and wander the Vienna streets until the time for his plane to depart. And as they talk and walk through Vienna, they fall in love.;Richard Linklater;Richard Linklater,Kim Krizan;/celebrity/richard_linklater,/celebrity/kim_krizan;as Jesse,as Celine,as Wife on Train,as Husband on Train,as Guy on Bridge,as Guy on Bridge,as Palm Reader,as Street Poet,as Bartender,as Book Store Manager,as Journalist #1,as Guitarist in Club,as Belly Dancer,as Journalist #2,as Percussionist,as Waitress,as Philippe,as Cafe Patron,as Man at Grill,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Cafe Patron,as Musician on Boat,as Musician on Boat,as Harpsichord Player;Before Sunrise;https://resizing.flixster.com/i4dnh_IPTUnKG7DNpQpqoYvK8T8=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODUyMTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles. ~ Jason Clark, Rovi;Ted Demme;Nick Cassavetes,David McKenna;/celebrity/nick_cassavetes,/celebrity/david_mckenna;as George Jung,as Mirtha,as Diego Delgado,as Barbara,as Ermine Jung,as Fred Jung,as Tuna,as Derek Foreal,as Kevin Dulli,as Escobar,as Augusto Oliveras,as Augusto Oliveras,as Leon Minghella,as Mr. T,as Alessandro,as Cesar Toban,as Sanchez,as Doctor Bay,as Maria,as Rada,as Inez,as Kristina Jung,as Young Kristina Jung,as Young George;Blow;https://resizing.flixster.com/JvjDCwaLvI3mmLSL5_NJK64g5cw=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2NzkxNztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

On October 3rd, 1993, an elite team of more than 100 Delta Force soldiers and Army Rangers, part of a larger United Nations peacekeeping force, are dropped into civil war-torn Mogadishu, Somalia, in an effort to kidnap two of local crime lord Mohamed Farah Aidid's top lieutenants. Among the team: Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), the resourceful Delta Sgt. First Class Jeff Sanderson (William Fichtner), and Ranger Spec. Grimes (Ewan McGregor), a desk-bound clerk getting his first taste of live combat. When two of the mission's Black Hawk helicopters are shot down by enemy forces, the Americans -- committed to recovering every man, dead or alive -- stay in the area too long and are quickly surrounded. The ensuing firefight is a merciless 15-hour ordeal and the longest ground battle involving American soldiers since the Vietnam War. In the end, 70 soldiers are injured and 18 are dead, along with hundreds of Somalians. Black Hawk Down was voted one of the top ten films of the year by the National Board of Review prior to its limited Oscar-qualifying release. On the basis of his work in this film, co-star Eric Bana, a relatively unknown Australian actor playing Delta Sgt. First Class ""Hoot"" Gibson, won the lead in director Ang Lee's version of The Hulk (2003). ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Ridley Scott;Ken Nolan;/celebrity/ken_nolan;as Eversmann,as Grimes,as McKnight,as Hoot,as Garrison,as Nelson,as Sanderson,as Smith,as Twombly,as Yurek,as Steele,as Durant,as Schmid,as Shughart,as Galentine,as Kurth,as Wex,as Beales,as Pilla,as Harrell,as Matthews,as Wolcott,as Kowalewski,as Busch,as Struecker,as Gordon,as Cribbs,as Waddell,as Goodale,as Joyce,as Thomas,as Sizemore,as Blackburn,as Othic,as Ruiz,as Maddox,as Atto,as Mo'alim,as Firimbi,as Somali Spy,as Briley,as Fales,as Wilkinson,as Goffena,as Jollata,as Somali Kid,as Somali Kid,as Somali Father,as Somali son with gun;Black Hawk Down;https://resizing.flixster.com/qCH39mhF3NEmtENR_YKX4cEEBwE=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2Nzk3NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

The alien (Jeff Bridges) chooses the likeness of the recently deceased husband of Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen). At first dumbstruck, Jenny becomes both hostile toward and frightened of her guest. He gradually wins her confidence, learning a few vital English-language phrases so that he can explain his presence. The ""starman"" has come to Earth with a message of peace, in response to the similar message sent out on Voyager One. He asks for Jenny's help in transporting him to the Nevada desert, where his fellow aliens are to pick him up and take him to his home planet. Soon he and Jenny form a united front against a mean-spirited National Security Council agent (Richard Jaeckel), who intends to seize the starman and turn him over for scientific scrutiny (and possible extermination). While en route to Nevada, Jenny grows closer to the gentle-natured Starman, eventually making love with him. By the time he is poised to leave, she is carrying his child, leaving the field wide open for a sequel--which was never produced, though a weekly TV version surfaced in 1986.";John Carpenter;Raynold Gideon,Bruce A.

As the Allies unite overseas to keep the world safe for democracy, there are voices at home that are barely heard. One of them belongs to Willie Morris, a shy and gawky eight-year-old whose childhood is even more quiet and isolated than his home town of Yazoo, Mississippi. An only child, ignored at school and uncomfortable with girls, Willie looks up to and confides in next-door neighbor Dink Jenkins, the town's star athlete, who's preparing to ship out in the service of Uncle Sam. Willie's father, Jack Morris, a stern but good-hearted veteran who lost his leg in the Spanish Civil War, is chiefly responsible for Willie's overprotective upbringing. Pushing in the other direction is his mother, Ellen Morris, a capable woman who knows that what Willie needs most is some freedom and a friend. Willie's ninth birthday gives her an opportunity to offer him both, in the form of a Jack Russell terrier puppy that the delighted Willie names Skip. Skip's outgoing personality helps Willie to build a friendship with Rivers Applewhite, the prettiest girl in school. Skip then further serves as matchmaker for Willie and Rivers at the movie theater, and lends a paw after Willie is challenged by Big Boy Wilkinson, Henjie Henick and Spit McGee to prove his worth in a football game. With Skip's canine help, Willie starts becoming ""one of the boys."" Then unexpectedly, Dink returns to Yazoo. But the dark truth soon emerges: Dink, when confronted by the realities of war, went AWOL. In trying to reconcile his hero worship of the Dink he once knew with his disappointment in the disgraced soldier, Willie begins to contend with the complexities of war and human conduct. He reaches a new perspective on these matters through his father's eyes and his own. Dink fails to show up at Willie's first baseball game, and the disappointed Willie takes it out on Skip, who runs away. The dog's disappearance and subsequent recovery teach Willie the strength of forgiveness, and give Dink a chance to embrace the power of redemption. Ultimately, it is a dog's love that teaches Willie Morris lifelong lessons of the human spirit.";Jay Russell;Gail Gilchriest;/celebrity/gail_gilchriest;as Willie Morris,as Jack Morris,as Ellen Morris,as Dink Jenkins,as Big Boy Wilkinson,as Henjie Henick,as Spit McGee,as Rivers Applewhite,as Army Buddy,as Older Willie,as Narrator,as Skip,as Hunter No. 1,as Skip (older),as Barney,as Grandmother Mamie,as Snake Girl,as Junior Smalls,as Aunt Maggie,as Skip,as Spectator,as Man on Street,as Spectator,as Army Buddy,as Mrs. Jenkins,as Woman on Street,as Aunt Maggie,as Veterinarian,as Pump Jockey,as Hunter,as Mr. Goodloe,as Accordian Boy,as Baseball Coach,as Mrs. Applewhite,as Millard,as Waldo Grace,as Miss Abbott,as Sammy,as Accordion Boy,as Mr. Jenkins,as Rivers' Friend,as Bible Boy,as Grandfather Percy,as Baseball Coach,as Umpire,as Older Big Boy,as Lt.

Set to a true-to-period rock soundtrack, the story details the rise and fall of Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian New York kid who grows up idolizing the ""wise guys"" in his impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood. He begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. As he reaches his teens, Hill (Ray Liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a ""stand-up guy"" by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. From that moment on, he is a part of the family. Along with his psychotic partner Tommy (Joe Pesci), he rises through the ranks to become Paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a ""made guy,"" an actual member of the crime family. Soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings. Goodfellas was rewarded with six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture; Pesci would walk away with Best Supporting Actor for his work. ~ Jeremy Beday, Rovi";Martin Scorsese;Nicholas Pileggi,Martin Scorsese;/celebrity/1061471-nicholas_pileggi,/celebrity/martin_scorsese;as Henry Hill,as James Conway,as Tommy DeVito,as Karen Hill,as Paul Cicero,as Frankie Carbone,as Sonny Bunz,as Frenchy,as Billy Batts,as Vinnie,as Morris Kessler,as Tuddy Cicero,as Janice Rossi,as Sandy,as Belle Kessler,as Lois Byrd,as Himself,as Tommy's Mother,as Mickey Conway,as Himself,as Young Henry,as Karen's Mother,,as Bruce's Brother,,as Henry's Mother,as Henry's Father,as Michael Hill,as Spider,as Bobby Vinton,as Johnny Roastbeef,as Dr. Dan,as Tony,as Liquor Cop,as Johnny Dio,as Henry's 60s Crew,as Ronnie,as Tony Stacks,as Young Tommy,as Anthony Stabile,as Mikey Franzese,as Diane,as Bruce,as Nickey Eyes,as Cicero's Wife,as Bleeding Man,as Tuddy's Wife,as Arresting Narc,as Mrs. Carbone,as City Detective,as Frenchy's Wife,as Angie,as Fat Andy,as Rosie,as Janice's Girlfriend #1,as Susan,as Tommy's Girl Friend at Copa,as Henry's 70's Crew,as Joe Buddha,as Stacks Edwards,as Johnny Roastbeef's Wife,as Dealer,as Himself,as Defense Attorney,as Young Henry's Older Brother,as Young Michael,as Mailman,as Barbeque Wiseguy,as Bruce,as Bleeding Man,as Gambling Doorman,as Hijacked Driver,as School Guard,as Janice's Girl Friend,as Cop No. 1,as Mob Lawyer,as Judge, 1956,as Frankie the Wop,as Truck Driver at Diner,,as Fat Andy,as Freddy No Nose,as Pete the Killer,as Jimmy Two Times,as Man with Coatrack,as Young Henry's Sister,as Terrorized Waiter,as Bouncer,as Copa Captain,as Copa Announcer,as Beach Club Waiter,as Karen's Dad,as Marie No. 1,as Marie No. 2,as Paul No. 3,as Truck Driver,as Detective Deacy,as Detective Silvestri,as Batt's Crew No. 1,as Vito,as Vito's Girl Friend,as Batt's Crew No. 2,as Lisa,as Godfather at Table,as Prizefighter,as Carbone's Girl Friend,as Henry's Older Child, Judy,as Henry's Baby, Ruth,as Bar Patron,as Bridal Shop Owner,as Florida Bookie,as Judy Hill,as Bookie's Sister,as Judge, 1971,as Security Guard with Lobsters,as Young Henry's Sister #1,as Drug Buyer,as Prison Guard in Booth,as Judy Hill (age 10),as Ruth Hill (age 8),as Parole Officer,as Stacks' Girl Friend,as Joe Buddha's Wife,as Kid,as Garbage Man,as Doctor,as Judy Hill (age 13),as Ruth Hill (age 11),as Arresting Narc,as Henry's 70's Crew,as Henry Greeter #1,as Henry's 70's Crew,as Bruce's Brother #1,as Henry's 60's crew,as Mr. Tony Hood #1,as Henry's 70's Crew,as Cicero's 60's Crew,as Mr. Tony Hood #2,as City Detective #1,as Cicero's 60's Crew;GoodFellas;https://resizing.flixster.com/64RO9cYP_I5XZ8SA5b19-l35_5A=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2NjcyMztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Dr. Tanner (Paul Hilton) is a renegade scientist whose attempts to prove the existence of dragons -- which he believes lived on this planet at the same time as dinosaurs -- has cost him the respect of many in the archeological community. But a dig in Eastern Europe produced artifacts that suggests Tanner's theories may be valid after all. With the help of two of his colleagues (Aidan Woodward and Katrine Bach), Tanner examines the remains of what appear to have been dragons, and as he explains how they lived, his tales come to life in flashbacks illustrated by computer graphics technology.

Crash-landing on a faraway planet, Davidge is forced into an ""up close and personal"" with the Drac (Lou Gossett Jr.), a repellant, reptilian creature. Evidently a bivalve, the Drac gives birth to a baby Drac just before expiring. Now a reluctant foster father, Davidge tries to keep himself and the baby alive while the war continues to rage all around them. The special effects (courtesy Industrial Light and Magic) are serviceable if not brilliant, and the acting is okay so far as it goes. What socks over Enemy Mine is Rolf Zehetbauer's awe-inspiring production design and Chris Walas' superb makeup work.

Revell, who hates being touched, responds by challenging the unwilling Mitchell to a fight at three o'clock in the parking lot.

Sandra Bullock stars as Sidda Lee Walker, a New York playwright who opens a can of emotional worms with her estranged, boozy mother, Vivi (Ellen Burstyn), when she discusses her painful childhood and particularly Vivi's less-than-enviable mothering skills in a Time magazine article. The eccentric Louisiana drama queen Vivi has already been barred from her daughter's oft-delayed wedding to her fiancÃƒÂ©, Connor (Angus Macfadyen), so the article sends her into a rage. Coming to the rescue of the relationship are Necie (Shirley Knight), Caro (Maggie Smith), and Teensy (Fionnula Flanagan), a trio of bickering women, who, along with Vivi, formed a secret society of feminist empowerment and friendship 60 years earlier that they dubbed the ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood."" The Ya-Yas kidnap Sidda and bring her home to Louisiana, where they reveal to Sidda via a carefully maintained scrapbook her mother's painful past (with Vivi portrayed in flashback by Ashley Judd), effecting a rapprochement between mother and daughter. Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood also stars James Garner. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Callie Khouri;Callie Khouri,Mark Andrus;/celebrity/callie_khouri,/celebrity/mark_andrus;as Siddalee Walker,as Vivian Jane Abbott `Vivi' Walker,as Caro,as Teensy,as Necie,as Younger Vivian,as Shep Walker,as Younger Caro,as Younger Teensy,as Younger Necie,as Little Vivi,as Little Caro,as Little Teensy,as Little Necie,as Younger Shep Walker,as Jack,as Grandma Buggy,as Connor,as Genevieve,as Pete Abbott,as Taylor Abbott,as Willetta,as Older Willetta,as Chaney,as Pete Abbott,as Little Sidda,as Little Shep Jr.,as Lulu,as Baylor,as Aunt Louise,as James Jr.,as Dr. Beau Poche,as Shirley,as Mr. Whitman,as Officer Roscoe Jenkins,as Younger Chick,as Adult Shep Jr.,as Younger Chick,as Female Interviewer,as Stage Manager,as Confessional Priest,as Airplane Man,as Pilot,as Lyle Johnson,as Lady at Gas Station,as Pawn Broker,as Swing Band Singer,as Chanteuse,as Sister Solange;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood;https://resizing.flixster.com/MriyEWYY_uCow1NB-iagMQSOt3k=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MzY5MTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

In Peru in 1714, a rickety bridge collapsed as five people were attempting to cross, forcing them to plunge to their deaths. Brother Fray Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) is a Franciscan monk who has been given the duty of looking into the tragedy by the archbishop of Lima (Robert De Niro), and to learn what he can about the victims. It is Juniper's belief that these particular people died for some reason, and that it is his duty to determine why God chose these five people to perish, while others in the vicinity survived. After five years, Juniper delivers his findings to the archbishop as well as the viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham), as Juniper tells them of the lives of the troubled Dona Maria (Kathy Bates), the nun Pepita (Adriana Dominguez), warm-hearted Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel), street kid-turned-actress La Perichola (Pilar Lopez de Ayala), and others involved in the tragedy.

The trouble begins in 1917 when cartographer Reginald Anson is sent to Wales to make an official map of its terrain. He winds up in a tiny, anachronistic hamlet where the people do not have surnames, but are identified by their occupations or unusual characteristics. The humble townsfolk are hardworking and proud; especially of their mountain, Ffynnon Garw, which they claim is the first mountain in Wales. Unfortunately, the British government has officially decreed that only points that exceed 1,000 feet in elevation can be designated as mountains, and according to Anson's calculations, Ffynnon Garw, is only 984 feet; therefore, it is most definitely a hill. The villagers are outraged at this indignity, and do all they can, ranging from gentle coercion to outright threats to get the straight-arrow Anson to make it a mountain. In desperation, they all devise an ingenious solution and Ffynnon Garw's reputation of a mountain remains intact.";Christopher Monger;Christopher Monger;/celebrity/christopher_monger;as Reginald Anson,as Betty of Cardiff,as Morgan the Goat,as George Garrad,as Johnny Shellshocked,as Rev.

Joy and George Adamson (portrayed by real-life married couple Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers) involuntarily domesticate several lions while living in Kenya. They keep one, named Elsa, until she is fully grown, and rather than turn her over to a zoo, they decide to train her to live like a wild animal so that they can release her into her natural habitat. Geoffrey Keen is a sympathetic government official who convinces the Adamsons that they should set Elsa free to avoid being ordered to place her in captivity. The film, based on Joy Adamson's book, is poignant and emotional without ever becoming banal or overly sentimental. The title song and film score both won Academy Awards.;James Hill;Gerald L.C.

The younger Hanks plays Shaun Brumder, a high schooler eager to propel himself out of the land of surf bums and ranch homes to which the film's title refers. He's had his sights set on Stanford ever since he read the works of professor Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline), and his transcript is stellar enough to gain him admission. Shaun is understandably furious, then, when he receives a rejection letter in the mail; after some detective work on his part, he realizes that his flaky counselor (Lily Tomlin) mistakenly sent the university the wrong papers. It's up to him to get to Stanford within 24 hours to set the record straight -- literally -- and he enlists the help of his slacker brother Lance (Jack Black) to do so. Orange County co-stars Catharine O'Hara and John Lithgow as Shaun and Lance's slightly unhinged parents; the film was directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Mike White, both of whom contributed to several episodes of Freaks and Geeks. ~ Michael Hastings, Rovi";Jake Kasdan;Mike White;/celebrity/mike_white;as Shaun Brumder,as Lance,as Cindy Buegler,as Ashley,as Bud Brumder,as Charlotte Cobb,as Chad,as Lonny,as Principal Harbert,as Bob Beugler,as Lupe,as Mr. Burke,as Arthur Gantner,as Vera Gantner,as Don Durkett,as Arlo,as Dana,as Tanya,as Katie,as Male Student,as Shane Brainard,as Stoner,as Cheerleader,as Sarah,as Jake,as Krista,as Rosa,as Jorge,as Lucas,as Butch Female Janitor,as Mona,as Stephanie Durkett,as Gina Durkett,as Mrs. Durkett,as Public Safety,as Gretchen,as Party Girl,as Party Girl,as Kip,as Marcus Skinner (uncredited),as Firefighter (uncredited);Orange County;https://resizing.flixster.com/uhz1JmcPqmAgcKrwaMsR_3lmsX4=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2ODk2MTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Unlike the campy 1960s version of Batman, this version is half-mad from the superhero's obsession with justice. It is only his unusual sense of ethics that keeps him from becoming a full-blown psychotic. The story describes the origins of Batman as it follows the Dark Knight's attempts to capture the elusive, deadly Phantasm who kills a crime lord and makes it look as if Batman did it, causing a media smear campaign against the Caped Crusader. At the same time, millionaire Bruce Wayne holds a party at his mansion. There he meets Councilman Arthur Reeves, the man behind the accusations. Reeves derides playboy Wayne for allowing his college sweetheart Andrea Beaumont to leave him. Suddenly Wayne flashes back to his pre-Batman days. He remembers how he met her while visiting his parents' graves to renew his vow that he would spend his life fighting crime to avenge their wrongful deaths. He has already devised an early version of his alter-ego Batman, but that is nearly forgotten when he falls in love with Andrea. The story then jumps from past to present and back as the mysterious Phantasm strikes again. Batman continues his investigation and discovers a disturbing link between Andrea, who suddenly shows up after many years absence, and the villain. Meanwhile, the Phantasm, feeling that Batman is too close to learning his/her identity hires the Joker to kill him. But the Joker has his own agenda and much action ensues before the mystery of the Phantasm identity is solved, Batman clears his name, and justice is served. This film was originally made to go straight to video, Warner's studio liked it enough to release it theatrically.

Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg play three upwardly mobile New York bachelors who share an apartment. Their even-keel lifestyle is thrown out of whack when a young woman leaves a baby on their doorstep, suspecting that film director Danson is the father. The balance of the film is devoted to milking as much humor as possible out of the situation of three urbane young men trying to play nursemaid with nary a clue of what they're doing (at one point, a desperate Selleck offers Guttenberg a thousand dollars if Guttenberg will change a diaper). A subplot involving drug dealers is thrown in to sustain audience interest after our trio of heroes become accustomed to a baby around the apartment. ""Urban legend"" aficionados please note: That cardboard cutout of Ted Danson briefly glimpsed in one scene of Three Men and a Baby is not the ghost of a little boy who died in the bachelors' apartment before filming started.";Leonard Nimoy;James Orr,Jim Cruickshank,Coline Serreau;/celebrity/james_orr,/celebrity/jim_cruickshank,/celebrity/coline_serreau;as Peter Mitchell,as Jack Holden,as Michael Kellam,as Sylvia,as Mrs. Holden,as Rebecca,as Mary Bennington,as Mary Bennington,as Det.

He rides his rickety bicycle across the serenade landscape to and from the mines. He drinks beer in the local pub, fishes off a pier with his workmates Jurgen and Manfred, and watches them nearly come to blows over a chess game. For Schultze, that's really all the spice he needs. When he and his buddies are suddenly laid off at the mine and forced into retirement ten years too early, not even the polka music Schultze has played on the accordion since he was a boy can put the zest back into his life--but just maybe a little zydeco can! Wandering around his modest home, trying to find contentment in a life of leisure he never asked for, Schultze is channel surfing through radio stations one day when he suddenly catches an unfamiliar rift of music--lively music that puts a spring in his step that had never been there before. But what of polka? Try as he might, this zaftig salt miner, who has been churning out the same accordion music of generations before him, can't get zydeco out of his system. In an instant, years of music tradition tumbles as easily as the Berlin Wall, and much like that momentous event that brought Germany closer to the Western World, a tie forms between Schultze and America that simply has to be explored.;Michael Schorr;Michael Schorr;/celebrity/michael_schorr;as Schultze,as Manfred,as Jurgen,as Manfred,as Jurgen's wife,as Manfred's wife,as Gatekeeper,as Head of Music Club,as Lisa,as Schultze's Mother,as Josephine,as Aretha,as Nurse,as Frau Lorant;Schultze Gets the Blues;https://resizing.flixster.com/uTIfYBIkdoMVNntRbb_9iEFcwCk=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDk0MjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Austin's wardrobe is pure Carnaby Street at its most outrageous, his vocabulary is crowded by the cool lingo of the day (""Groovy, baby! Yeah!!""), and he's irresistible to women, despite the fact that he can be charitably described as ""stocky"" and has teeth that strike fear into any practicing dentist. When his nemesis, the arch-enemy Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), has himself cryogenically frozen and sent into space, Powers also has himself put on ice so he can be thawed out when Dr. Evil returns. Come 1997, Dr. Evil returns to Earth and is back to his old tricks, so Austin is thawed out and returned to active service -- though he soon discovers his style doesn't play so well 30 years on. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Hurley as Austin's sidekick, Vanessa Kensington; Michael York as his boss, Basil Exposition; Robert Wagner as Dr. Evil's assistant, Number Two; and Seth Green as Dr. Evil's troubled son, Scott Evil. Ming Tea, the swingin' pop band that periodically backs up Austin, includes real life pop-rockers Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was a mild box-office hit but an even bigger success on home video, which led to the 1999 sequel, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Jay Roach;Mike Myers;/celebrity/mike_myers;as Austin Powers/Dr. Evil,as Vanessa Kensington,as Basil Exposition,as Scott Evil,as No. 2,as Therapist,as Cowboy,as Mrs. Kensington,as Frau Farbissina,as Patty O'Brien,as Mustafa,as Commander Gilmour,as Himself,as Alotta Fagina,as '60s Model,as Mod Girl,as Andy Warhol,as Radar Operator,as Borschevsky,as Gary Coleman,as Vanilla Ice,as Quartermaster Clerk,as Go-Go Dancer,as Go-Go Dancer,as Go-Go Dancer,as Go-Go Dancer,as Go-Go Dancer,as Random Task,as Las Vegas Tourist,as Casino Dealer,,as Fembot,as Fembot,,as Fembot,as Fembot,as UN Secretary,,as Mrs. Exposition,as Son,as Dad,as Virtucon Tour Guide,as American UN Representative,as British UN Representative,as Eastern European Technician,as '60 Model,as '60 Model,,;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery;https://resizing.flixster.com/1J5TZ2hPNJXORJhAnhhoCstmavI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2NzkxOTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

His wife Carolyn (Alfre Woodard) works as a school teacher to keep food on the table. The Carmichaels have five children, a bright and introspective daughter named Troy (Zelda Harris) and four sons with a habit of causing trouble, and they all share an apartment in a brownstone in Brooklyn. Crooklyn follows the Carmichaels as the kids learn the funny and painful lessons of growing up, Mom and Dad balance their love for each other against the financial and personal difficulties of the creative life, and they all try to get along with the often eccentric neighbors on their block.

Updated to the 1970s, the original Robert Armstrong character is now Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin), a big-shot oil magnate from Petrox Oil, looking for new petroleum deposits on a recently discovered Pacific island. Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) is a counter-culture paleontologist, stowing away on Wilson's ship, who warns that they are headed for ""Skull Island,"" where prehistoric monsters still live and roam free. Also along for the ride is Dwan (Jessica Lange, in her film debut), a down-on-her-luck starlet, shipwrecked in the ocean after the sinking of a yacht. She really becomes down-on-her-luck when the group lands on the island and a giant ape, Kong, takes a shine to her. Kong kidnaps her and Dwan takes umbrage when the ape tries to remove her clothes by shouting, ""You male chauvinist ape!"" But Prescott comes to her aid and rescues her from the gorilla's big mits.

Cruise plays stock-car driver Cole Trickle, a young fireball on the Southern stock-car circuit who has loads of talent but no conception of how to channel that talent in to racing success. When Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) commissions veteran stock-car racer Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) to built a car and hires Cole to drive it, Harry must instill in Cole his philosophy of winning and teach him how to channel his raw talent into success -- or, as Harry puts it, ""controlling something that's out of control."" Cole immediately comes into conflict with the circuit's star driver, Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), and their hijinks on the track causes them to smash up their cars and lands them both in the hospital. Because of his injuries, Rowdy is forced to withdraw from the circuit competition. With no rival to torment, Rowdy becomes Cole's supporter and friend, while Cole revs up his motors for Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), the attractive brain specialist who supervises Cole's recovery from the crackup. Cole's health is restored, and he begins to race again, chastened and hanging onto Harry's every word. Cole appears to have centered himself for success, but in an orgasmic grand finale, Cole must compete against Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes), a dastardly driver who not only wants to see Cole defeated but permanently disabled. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi";Tony Scott;Robert Towne;/celebrity/robert_towne;as Cole Trickle,as Harry Hogge,as Dr. Claire Lewicki,as Tom Daland,as Russ Wheeler,as Rowdy Burns,as Big John,as Buck Bretherton,as Waddell,as Aldo Bennedetti,as Jennie Burns,as Darlene,as Harlan Hoogerhyde,as Len Dortort,as Lauren Daland,as Jack Man, Cole's Crew,as Tire Carrier, Cole's Crew,as Front Tire Changer, Cole's Crew,as Russ Wheeler's Girlfriend,as Hardee's Pit Crew Chief,as Donna,as Female Highway Patrol Officer,as Highway Patrol Officer,as Young Doctor,as Nurse;Days of Thunder;https://resizing.flixster.com/MShWiUi-KEv1ls_bY5qp06s02tI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2ODkzMTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Having read all about Guy, Bruno is aware that the tennis player is trapped in an unhappy marriage to to wife Miriam (Laura Elliott) and has been seen in the company of senator's daughter Ann Morton (Ruth Roman). Baiting Guy, Bruno reveals that he feels trapped by his hated father (Jonathan Hale). As Guy listens with detached amusement, Bruno discusses the theory of ""exchange murders."" Suppose that Bruno were to murder Guy's wife, and Guy in exchange were to kill Bruno's father? With no known link between the two men, the police would be none the wiser, would they? When he reaches his destination, Guy bids goodbye to Bruno, thinking nothing more of the affable but rather curious young man's homicidal theories. And then, Guy's wife turns up strangled to death. Co-adapted by Raymond Chandler from a novel by Patricia Highsmith, Strangers on a Train perfectly exemplifies Hitchcock's favorite theme of the evil that lurks just below the surface of everyday life and ordinary men. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi";Alfred Hitchcock;Raymond Chandler,Czenzi Ormonde,Whitfield Cook;/celebrity/raymond_chandler,/celebrity/czenzi_ormonde,/celebrity/whitfield_cook;as Guy Haines,as Anne Morton,as Sen.

When a meteor bearing single-celled organisms crashes to the Earth, the life forms are initially confined to a cave. Before long the creatures are evolving at an exponentially rapid rate, resulting in fearsome aliens running amok and possibly spelling mankind's doom, or at least the end of man's domination over life on Earth. Investigating the phenomenon is a community college professor, Ira Kane (David Duchovny), his geologist friend Harry Block (Orlando Jones), wannabe fireman Wayne Green (Seann William Scott), and government scientist Allison Reed (Julianne Moore).

Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish). But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson (Tom Sizemore) and his brother Ed (Bill Pullman). With his brothers, Virgil (Michael Madsen) and Morgan (Linden Ashby), Earp sets out to clean up the violence-plagued towns of the old West -- by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock (Mare Winningham), a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus (Joanna Going). In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday (Dennis Quaid), who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton (Jeff Fahey). ~ Michael Betzold, Rovi;Lawrence Kasdan;Lawrence Kasdan,Dan Gordon;/celebrity/lawrence_kasdan,/celebrity/1049870-dan_gordon;as Wyatt Earp,as Doc Holliday,as Nicholas Earp,as Virgil Earp,as James Earp,as Morgan Earp,as Allie Earp,as Ed Masterson,as Josie Marcus,as Ike Clanton,as Sheriff Johnny Behan,as Big Nose Kate,as Bat Masterson,as Bessie Earp,as Mattie Earp,as Mr. Sutherland,as Frank McLaury,as John Clum,as Tom McLaury,as Urilla Sutherland,as Curly Bill Brocius,as Young Wyatt,as Virginia Earp,,as Lou Earp,as Sherman McMasters,as Young Man on Boat,as Warren Earp,as Mrs. Sutherland,as Frank Stilwell,as Sally,as Frank Stillwell,as Ed Ross,as Bob Hatch,as Pete Spence,as Johnny Ringo,as Marshall White,as Indian Charlie,as Billy Clanton,as Billy Claiborne,as Judge Spicer,as Dutch Wiley,as Erwin Sutherland,as Traveler,as John Shanssey,as Martha Earp,as Young Morgan,as Young Warren,as Gyp Clements,as Tom Chapman,as Bullwacker,as Dirty Sodbuster,as Friend of Bullwacker,as Red,as Mike Donovan,as Faro Dealer,as Judge Earp,as Dr. Seger,as Camp Foreman,as Stable Hand,as Minister,,as Paris,as Pine Bluff Sheriff,as Tubercular Inmate,as Tommy Behind-the-Deuce,as Tent Saloon Bartender,as Link Borland,as Mayor Wilson,as Deputy Ford,as Marshall Meagher,as Larry Deger,as Mannen Clements,as Big Cowboy,as Drunk Cowboy,as Drunk Cowboy,as Wagner,as Walker,as Hotel Resident,as Delivery Boy,as Deputy Black,as Spangenberg,as Saddle Tramp,as Saloon Dealer,as Bar Regular,as Danny,as Marshall White's Wife,as Bar Patron,as Clem Hafford,as Rancher,as Texas Jack,as Turkey Creek Jack,as Billiard Parlor Patron,as Barboy,as Station Master,as Albert,as Camp Foreman,as McGee,as Dick Gird;Wyatt Earp;https://resizing.flixster.com/xwZRRGiEBuuoYhtXKHJU461fW-Y=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2NzkzODtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

What's needed, says British general Bernard Law Montgomery, is a knockout punch, a bold strike through Holland, where German troops are spread thin, that will put the Allies into Germany. Paratroops led by British major general Robert Urquhart (Sean Connery) and American brigadier general James Gavin (Ryan O'Neal) will seize a thin road and five bridges through Holland into Germany, with paratroops led by Lieutenant Col. John Frost (Sir Anthony Hopkins) holding the most critical bridge at a small town called Arnhem. Over this road shall pass combined forces led by British Lieutenant Gen. Brian Horrocks (Edward Fox) and British Lieutenant Col. Joe Vandeleur (Michael Caine). The plan requires precise timing, so much so that one planner tells Lieutenant Gen. Frederick Browning (Dirk Bogarde), ""Sir, I think we may be going a bridge too far."" The plan also has one critical flaw: Instead of a smattering of German soldiers, the area around Arnhem is loaded with crack SS troops. Disaster ensues. Based on a book by historian Cornelius Ryan, A Bridge Too Far is reminiscent of another movie based on a Ryan book, The Longest Day. Like that movie, it is loaded with more than 15 international stars, including Sir Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford, Hardy Krueger, Gene Hackman, Maximilian Schell, and Liv Ullman. ~ Nick Sambides, Jr., Rovi";Sidney Hayers,Richard Attenborough;William Goldman;/celebrity/william_goldman;as Lt.

Xavier (Romain Duris) is a French economics student who is nearing the completion of his degree and is looking for work. Xavier's father arranges for him to meet a ranking member of the Ministry of Finance, who makes him an offer -- he can give him a good job, but only under the condition that he learn to speak Spanish. Determined not to pass up the opportunity, Xavier enrolls in a language program in Barcelona, despite the misgivings of his girlfriend, Martine (Audrey Tautou). Upon his arrival, Xavier moves into a large house shared by a large group of students from all over Europe. Xavier finds that his ideas and attitudes are challenged in a positive way by the diverse personalities of his housemates, and that his loyalty to Martine is tested by his attraction to Anne-Sophie (Judith GodrÃƒÂ¨che), a sweet but lonesome woman from France who has been away from her husband for too long. After a visit, most of Xavier's roommates decide they don't much care for Martine and Xavier gets advice on seducing Anne-Sophie from an unexpected source -- Isabelle (CÃƒÂ©cile de France), a footloose lesbian living in the house.

It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero.

A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Francis Ford Coppola;Francis Ford Coppola,Mario Puzo;/celebrity/francis_ford_coppola,/celebrity/mario_puzo;as Don Vito Corleone,as Michael Corleone,as Sonny Corleone,as Clemenza,as Tom Hagen,as McCluskey,as Jack Woltz,as Barzini,as Kay Adams,as Sollozzo,as Tessio,as Connie Rizzi,as Carlo Rizzi,as Fredo Corleone,as Cuneo,as Johnny Fontane,as Mama Corleone,as Luca Brasi,as Bonasera,as Neri,as Moe Greene,as Bruno Tattaglia,as Nazorine,as Theresa Hagen,as Phillip Tattaglia,as Lucy Mancini,as Sandra Corleone,as Mrs. Clemenza,as Apollonia,as Fabrizio,as Don Tommasino,as Calo,as Vitelli,as Paulie Gatto,as Piano Player (uncredited),as Baby (uncredited),as Willy Cicci (uncredited),;The Godfather;https://resizing.flixster.com/4nrfR6YBEat38jKAVGJsg0AUFtA=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MTYxMjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cab driver who hopes to some day open his own limo company; one night behind the wheel begins promisingly when he picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), an attorney working with the federal government who is attractive, friendly, and gives him her business card after paying her fare. Max thinks his luck is getting even better when his next fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise), offers him several hundred dollars in cash if he'll be willing to drop him off, wait, and pick him up at five different spots over the course of the evening. Max agrees, but he soon realizes Vincent isn't just another guy with errands to run -- Vincent is an assassin who has been paid to murder five people who could put the leaders of a powerful drug trafficking ring behind bars in an upcoming trial. As circumstances force Max to do Vincent's bidding, the cabbie has to find a way to prevent Vincent from killing again and save his own skin, a task that becomes especially crucial when he discovers Annie is one of the names on Vincent's hit list.

The tale's heroine, Tita, is the youngest of three daughters in a traditional Mexican family. Bound by tradition to remain unmarried while caring for her aging mother, Tita nevertheless falls in love with a handsome young man named Pedro. Pedro returns her affection, but he cannot overcome her family's disapproval, and he instead marries Tita's elder sister. The lovestruck young woman is brutally disappointed, and her sadness has such force that it infects her cooking: all who eat it her feel her heartbreak with the same intensity. This newly discovered power continues to manifest itself after the wedding, as Tita and Pedro, overcome by their denied love, embark on a secret affair. Director Alfonso Arau, Esquival's husband at the time, presents the acts of love and cooking with the same glossy, sensual sheen. Indeed, despite occasional digressions into a magical realist tone, the film often takes on the gloss of Hollywood romance. This combination of traditional melodrama and exotic fairy tale proved extremely popular with audiences, particularly in the United States, where it became one of the highest grossing foreign language films at the time. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi;Alfonso Arau;Laura Esquivel;/celebrity/laura_esquivel;as Tita,as Pedro Muzquiz,as Doctor John Brown,as Mama Elena,as John Brown,as Nacha,as Rosaura,as Gertrudis,as Chencha,as Priest,as Cura,as Sergeant Trevino,as Nicolas,as Juan Alejandrez,as Paquita Lobo,as Esperanza,as Alex,as Nicolas,as Rosalio,as Juan de la Garza,as Aunt Mary,as Pedro's Father,as Great Niece--Narrator,as Paquita's Friend,as Godfather,as Young Alex,as Young Tita;Like Water for Chocolate (Como Agua para Chocolate);https://resizing.flixster.com/36aft480nqBWCLs2nc3bJwipBJ0=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3OTk0NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

A reluctant leader, Arthur wishes only to leave Britain and return to the peace and stability of Rome. Before he can head for Rome, one final mission leads him and his Knights of the Round Table, Lancelot, Galahad, Bors, Tristan, and Gawain to the conclusion that when Rome is gone, Britain needs a king--someone not only to defend against the current threat of invading Saxons, but to lead the isle into a new age. Under the guidance of Merlin, a former enemy, and the beautiful, courageous Guinevere by his side, Arthur will have to find the strength within himself to change the course of history.;Antoine Fuqua;David H.

He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi;Steven Spielberg;Steven Zaillian;/celebrity/steven_zaillian;as Oskar Schindler,as Itzhak Stern,as Amon Goeth,as Emilie Schindler,as Poldek Pfefferberg,as Poldek Pfefferberg,as Helen Hirsch,,as Wilek Chilowicz,,,as Marcel Goldberg,as Ingrid,as Julian Scherner,as Victoria Klonowska,as Rolf Czurda,as Herman Toffel,as Leo John,as Albert Hujar,as Rolf Czurda,as Diana Reiter,as Mila Pfefferberg,as Juda Dresner,as Danka Dresner,as Nightclub Maitre d',as Henry Rosner,as Manci Rosner,as Rabbi Menasha Levartov,as Josef Bau,as Investor,as Investor,as OD/Chicken Boy,as Mr. Lowenstein,as DEF Foreman,as Lisiek,as Investigator,as Majola,as Dieter Reeder,as Waiter,as SS Waffen Officer,as Wilhelm Kunde,as Auschwitz Guard,as SS Waffen Man,as Gestapo Brinnlitz,as Border Guard,as Czurda's Girl,as Brinnlitz Man,as SS Guard Zablocie,as SS NCO Zablocie,as SS NCO-Ghetto,as Black Marketeer,as Regina Perlman,as Josef Liepold,as Rudolph Hoss,as Auschwitz Guard,as Grun,as Depot Master,;Schindler's List;https://resizing.flixster.com/CuoPsOwDCXKhu5RHZ19jaMtdWXU=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODUwODtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODUyOzExMzY

In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek.

When an attractive and mysterious hitchhiker subsequently offers to give the thrill seekers a personal tour of Dr. Satan's old stabbing grounds, a breakdown forces them to take refuge with a group of menacing oddballs as a fearsome storm rages outside.

That's the dilemma that faces mild-mannered computer jockey Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix. It's the year 1999, and Anderson (hacker alias: Neo) works in a cubicle, manning a computer and doing a little hacking on the side. It's through this latter activity that Thomas makes the acquaintance of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has some interesting news for Mr. Anderson -- none of what's going on around him is real. The year is actually closer to 2199, and it seems Thomas, like most people, is a victim of The Matrix, a massive artificial intelligence system that has tapped into people's minds and created the illusion of a real world, while using their brains and bodies for energy, tossing them away like spent batteries when they're through.

Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three who, after losing a personal injury lawsuit, asks her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), if he can help her find a job. Ed gives her work as a file clerk in his office, and she runs across some information on a little-known case filed against Pacific Gas and Electric. Erin begins digging into the particulars of the case, convinced that the facts simply don't add up, and persuades Ed to allow her to do further research; in time, she discovers a systematic cover-up of the industrial poisoning of a city's water supply, which threatens the health of the entire community.

This is the credo of the aptly named Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), the antihero of Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Gekko, a high-rolling corporate raider, is idolized by young-and-hungry broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Inveigling himself into Gekko's inner circle, Fox quickly learns to rape, murder and bury his sense of ethics. Only when Gekko's wheeling and dealing causes a near-tragedy on a personal level does Fox ""reform""-though his means of destroying Gekko are every bit as underhanded as his previous activities on the trading floor. Director Stone, who cowrote Wall Street with Stanley Weiser, has claimed that the film was prompted by the callous treatment afforded his stockbroker father after 50 years in the business; this may be why the film's most compelling scenes are those between Bud Fox and his airline mechanic father (played by Charlie Sheen's real-life dad Martin). Ironically, Wall Street was released just before the October, 1987 stock market crash. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi";Oliver Stone;Oliver Stone,Stanley Weiser,Stanley G.

Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) is a young and vital member of the aristocratic classes in 16th century Italy; however, Bassanio's impulsive nature and lavish lifestyle have put him deeply in debt, and he will need at least the pretense of a fortune if he is to win the hand of the beautiful Portia (Lynn Collins). Bassanio turns to his close friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons), a successful businessman, for financial help, but with much of his fortune tied up in a sailing expedition, Antonio can do little to help him. To help Bassanio, Antonio turns to Shylock (Al Pacino), a Jewish money lender who lives in Venice's Semetic ghetto. Antonio has often expressed his contempt for Shylock, who charges high rates for his loans, and Shylock clearly seems pleased at the ironic prospect of having Antonio as a customer; however, instead of interest, Shylock demands an unusual security on his loan -- though Shylock demands no interest, if Antonio does not repay the three thousand ducats in three months, Shylock will be entitled to a pound of his flesh. This version of The Merchant of Venice was directed by Michael Radford, best known for the international hit Il Postino, and was shot on locations in Venice and Luxembourg. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Michael Radford;Michael Radford;/celebrity/michael_radford;as Shylock,as Antonio,as Bassanio,as Portia,as Jessica,as Gratiano,as Lorenzo,as Launcelot Gobbo,as Nerissa,as Salerio,as Tubal,as Solanio,as Tubal,as Old Gobbo,,,;William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice;https://resizing.flixster.com/xzYfygGW8VaMh36tQ8-FitirhHg=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDc1NztqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7NjAwOzgwMA

In 1193 B.C., Paris, Prince of Troy (Orlando Bloom), has fallen in love; however, the beautiful woman who has beguiled him is Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), who is wed to King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). While Helen is hardly immune to Paris' charms, this doesn't blunt Menelaus' fury when Paris steals her away from him. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the power-hungry king of the Mycenaeans, is eager to expand his empire through Troy to the lands of the Aegean Sea, and he uses Paris' romantic slight against Menelaus as an excuse to wage an all-out war against the great walled city. Priam, King of Troy (Peter O'Toole), summons his armies, led by Prince Hector (Eric Bana), to meet the onslaught of Agamemnon's forces, but while the great city has yet to yield in a battle, Agamemnon has a formidable ally -- Achilles (Brad Pitt), a mighty and seemingly unstoppable warrior whose presence could tip the scales in Agamemnon's favor.

Donnie is also visited on occasion by Frank, a monstrous six-foot rabbit that only Donnie can see who often urges him to perform dangerous and destructive pranks. Late one night, Frank leads Donnie out of his home to inform him that the world will come to an end in less than a month; moments later, the engine of a jet aircraft comes crashing through the ceiling of Donnie's room, making him think there might be something to Frank's prophesies after all. The rest of Donnie's world is only marginally less bizarre, as he finds himself dealing with his confused parents (Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne), his college-age sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal), his perplexed analyst (Katherine Ross), a rebellious English teacher (Drew Barrymore), a sleazy self-help expert (Patrick Swayze), and the new girl at school who is attracted by Donnie's quirks (Jena Malone).

However, when Schrader turned in his film to executives at Morgan Creek Productions, the producers felt the film was not marketable, and they opted to remake the picture with director Renny Harlin, who brought a more visually aggressive approach to the story than Schrader's more contemplative vision. In 2004, Harlin's film, Exorcist: The Beginning, was released to middling critical and financial response, while the following year, Schrader's version went into limited release following film festival screenings. In Schrader's Exorcist: The Prequel, Father Lankester Merrin, the aging exorcist from the original story (played here by Stellan SkarsgÃƒÂ¥rd) is introduced in 1944, as he serves a flock in Holland during the Nazi occupation. After Nazi officers force Merrin to choose ten members of his congregation for immediate execution, Merrin is left an emotionally broken man, and he takes a leave of absence from his duties. Three years later, Merrin is taking part in an archeological project in East Africa, and he and his crew -- including priest Father Francis (Gabriel Mann), Major Granville (Julian Wadham), and Rachel Lesno (Clara Bellar) -- discover that a church from the fifth century has been buried in the desert. As Merrin and his associates discover that that a porthole to evil is located in the church, Cheche (Billy Crawford), a local boy Merrin has taken under his wing, begins showing signs of having fallen under the spell of Satanic forces.;Paul Schrader;Paul Schrader,William Wisher Jr.,Caleb Carr;/celebrity/paul_schrader,/celebrity/william_wisher_jr,/celebrity/caleb_carr;as Father Lankester Merrin,as Father Francis,as Rachel Lesno,as Cheche,as Jomo,as Sergeant Major,as Jomo,as Chuma,as Kessel,as Major Granville,as Emekwi,as Sebituana,as Corporal,as Private,as Dr. Lamu,as Dutch Farmer;Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist;https://resizing.flixster.com/3USc_F44hc1Xxwv1FKesX8AnU9k=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODQ5MztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior (M. Emmett Walsh), Deckard is forced back into active duty. A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon (Brion James), Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael (Sean Young), Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris (Darryl Hannah) use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. In 1992, Ridley Scott released a popular director's cut that removed Deckard's narration, added a dream sequence, and excised a happy ending imposed by the results of test screenings; these legendary behind-the-scenes battles were chronicled in a 1996 tome, Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M.

From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel (hardly a common moment in a major studio film in 1960), Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One afternoon, Marion is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film.

After his wife and daughter are killed in a snowbound car accident, classical composer John Russell (George C. Scott) relocates from New York to Seattle to teach at his alma mater. Looking for a quiet place to rest and continue writing music, he is referred Claire Norman (Trish Van Devere) at the Seattle Historical Preservation Society. Claire shows John a large, sparsely furnished estate in the outlying countryside. He takes the house, appreciating its remoteness and the solitude it might afford, and diverts himself by renovating and settling in. He even starts to compose, putting aside his older work in favor of a new, sentimental piece for the piano. It is not long, however, before he begins having nightmares about the accident that killed his wife and daughter. Possibly because of this trauma, he is open to communications from the house's ghostly occupants. Pursuing a loud, repetitive pounding noise in an upper room, he stumbles on the apparition of a young boy drowning in a tub. Working together with Claire, John discovers frightening parallels between this vision and buried events from the house's past. Horror writer M.R. James once said that his goal as a writer was to make the reader feel ""pleasantly uncomfortable."" Those looking for a similar experience in movies will appreciate The Changeling as a gem in the horror genre.";Peter Medak;Diana Maddox,William Gray Espy;/celebrity/diana_maddox,/celebrity/william_gray_espy;as John Russell,as Claire Norman,as Sen.

Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, Amelie didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine (Lorella Cravotta) died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight, and her father Raphael (Rufus) had limited contact with her, since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this, Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997, Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her, hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette (Isabelle Nanty), a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria, and Joseph (Dominique Pinon), an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment, she returns them to their former owner, Mr. Bretodeau (Maurice Benichou), sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel (Serge Merlin), an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle, thanks to a rare disease, that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris. Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain received unusually enthusiastic advance reviews prior to its French premiere in the spring of 2001, and was well received at a special free screening at that year's Cannes Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Jean-Pierre Jeunet;Guillaume Laurant,Jean-Pierre Jeunet;/celebrity/guillaume_laurant,/celebrity/jeanpierre_jeunet;as AmÃƒÂ©lie Poulain,as Nino Quincampoix,as Raymond Dufayel,as RaphaÃƒÂ«l Poulain,as Lucien,as Madeleine Wallace,as Collignon,as Joseph,as Amandine Poulain,as Dominique Bretodeau,as Mr. Collignon,as Georgette,as Madame Suzanne,as Gina,as Hipolito,as Philomene,as Eva,as L'homme dans la photo,as L'aveugle,as Amelie (age 8),as Nino (as a child),as L'inconnu des photomatons,as Le voisin d'AmÃƒÂ©lie,as Eugene Koler,as Mrs. Collignon,as The Newsstand Woman,as Petites mains du gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rique,as L'homme ÃƒÂ  la vespasienne,as Amandine's Grocer,as La femme dans le coma,as Le client qui humilie son ami,as Le client humiliÃƒÂ©,as The Humiliated Customer's Son,as Le clochard,as The Endive Client,as Son copain,as Le S.D.F.,as Dominique Bredoteau Woman,as Bretodeau enfant,as La concierge du mort,as La Tante Josette,as L'instituteur,as Le patron du bistrot,as Son employÃƒÂ©e,as La cliente du tabac,as Le client du cafÃƒÂ©,as Une cliente de l'ÃƒÂ©picerie,as Le contrÃƒÂ´leur du train,as Les jumelles #1,as Les jumelles #2,as La femme qui rit,as Samantha,as La caissiÃƒÂ¨re du train fantÃƒÂ´me,as La femme prÃƒÂ¨s du manÃƒÂ¨ge,as L'homme statue,as Le petit garÃƒÂ§on du SacrÃƒÂ©-Coeur,as Le souffleur de rue,as Le facteur de la concierge,as Le facteur de Poulain,as Felix L'Herbier,as Palace Video,as Jacques Grosjean,as Le mari de la concierge;AmÃƒÂ©lie;https://resizing.flixster.com/DkMVj3uPaL2reJLuP7HytWOD7C4=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODQ4ODtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTQxMzsxODg0

In one six-day period, there were twenty-four abductions, leading many to hire bodyguards for their children. Into this world enters John Creasy, a burned-out ex-CIA operative/assassin, who has given up on life. Creasy's friend Rayburn brings him to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to nine-year-old Pita Ramos, daughter of industrialist Samuel Ramos and his wife Lisa. Creasy is not interested in being a bodyguard, especially to a youngster, but for lack of something better to do, he accepts the assignment. Creasy barely tolerates the precocious child and her pestering questions about him and his life. But slowly, she chips away at his seemingly impenetrable exterior, his defenses drop, and he opens up to her. Creasy's new-found purpose in life is shattered when Pita is kidnapped. Despite being mortally wounded during the kidnapping, he vows to kill anyone involved in or profiting from the kidnapping.

A hapless electronics store employee who spends most of his spare time downing pints at the local pub with his roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun's life seems to fall apart when he is dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), and his obnoxious stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), shows up to berate him for not being more attentive to his caring mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) -- especially since he forgot to send flowers for her birthday. Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi;Edgar Wright;Simon Pegg,Edgar Wright;/celebrity/simon_pegg,/celebrity/pegg_and_edgar_wright;as Shaun,as Liz,as Ed,as Dianne,as David,,as Philip,as Barbara,,,as Yvonne,,as Declan,,,as Mary,as Pete,as Himself,as Nelson,,as Noel,,as Danny;Shaun of the Dead;https://resizing.flixster.com/CK5yB-7Y1NTiNNVvAeGUQirKJBE=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3MDc2NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

En route to Chicago to spend Thanksgiving with his family, easily annoyed businessman Neal Page (Steve Martin) finds his first-class plane ticket has been demoted to coach, and he must share his flight with obnoxious salesman Del Griffith (John Candy). A sudden snowstorm in Chicago forces the plane to land in Wichita. Unable to find a room in any of the four-star hotels, Neal is compelled to accept Del's invitation to share his accommodations in a cheapo-sleazo motel. Driven to distraction by Del's annoying personal habits, the ungrateful Neal lets forth with a stream of verbal abuse. That's when Del delivers the anticipated (but always welcome) ""I don't judge, why should you?""-type speech so common to John Hughes flicks. The shamefaced Neal tries to make up to Del, but there's a bumpy time ahead as the mismatched pair make their way back to Chicago, first in a balky train, then by way of a refrigerator truck.

In this version, Ichabod (Johnny Depp) is a New York City detective whose unorthodox techniques and penchant for gadgets make him unpopular with is colleagues. He is sent to the remote town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre murders, in which a number of people have been found dead in the woods, with their heads cut off. Local legend has it that a Hessian ghost rides through the woods on horseback, lopping off the heads of the unsuspecting and unbelieving. Ichabod refuses to believe in this legend, convinced that there must be a logical explanation for the murders. In time, Ichabod becomes smitten with a local lass, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), who is the sweetheart of the burly Brom Bones (Casper Van Dien), and he becomes determined to capture the murderer to prove his bravery and win her heart. Christopher Walken, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Lee highlight the supporting cast; Lee's appearance is particularly apt, since Burton has cited the Hammer films of the 1960s as a major influence in making this film. Andrew Kevin Walker and Tom Stoppard contributed to the screenplay. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Tim Burton;Andrew Kevin Walker;/celebrity/andrew_kevin_walker;as Ichabod Crane,as Katrina Van Tassel,as Lady Van Tassel,as Brom Van Brunt,as Baltus Van Tassel,as Headless Horseman,as Young Masbeth,as Hardenbrook,as Burgomaster,as Steenwyck,as Lady Crane,as Phillipse,as Doc Lancaster,as Killian,as Beth Killian,as Van Garrett (uncredited),as Headless Horseman,as High Constable,as Jonathan Masbeth,as Sarah,as Icahbod's father,;Sleepy Hollow;https://resizing.flixster.com/AMy5rpLDmaA8L_voHpyC-PEVVCY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2ODk2NztqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Dwarfed by towering trees, Blake slowly makes his way through dense woods. He scrambles down an embankment to a fresh spring and undresses for a short swim. The next morning he returns to his house, an elegant, if neglected, stone mansion. Many people are looking for Blake -- his friends, his managers and record label, even a private detective -- but he does not want to be found. In the haze of his final hours, Blake will spend most his time by himself. He avoids the people who are living in his house, who approach him only when they want something, be it money or help with a song. He hides from one concerned friend and turns away another. He visits politely with a stranger from the Yellow Pages sales department, and he ducks into an underground rock club. He wanders through the woods and he plays a new song, one last rock and roll blowout.

Joel Goodman (Rick Hearst) is content with his high-paying job and his happy home life, but when a hard-working and high-ranking colleague literally works himself to death, the friendly competition between Joel and his co-worker Tom (Sean Kanan) turns as serious as a heart attack. In Joel's eyes, the only thing standing between him and the newly available corner office is the slow-going, bumper-to-bumper Los Angeles traffic that he is forced to contend with on a daily basis -- a problem easily resolved when Joel hires a homeless man (Anthony Geary) to join him in the daily commute so that Joel may have access to the faster moving carpool lanes. Though at first the pair seem to have little in common, conversation soon reveals that, despite outward appearances, Joel's new traveling companion knows a thing or two about getting ahead in business, and that in order to be successful in the office one must first find happiness in the home.;Corbin Bernsen;Shaun Edwardes,Corbin Bernsen,Peter Soldinger;/celebrity/shaun_edwardes,/celebrity/corbin_bernsen,/celebrity/peter_soldinger;as Joel Goodman,as Tom,as Carpool Guy/Oliver Fasst,as Mrs. Lunsford,as Michael, Michael Lundsford,as Hope,as Steven,as Patty,as Ross,as Vanessa,as Dayna;Carpool Guy;https://resizing.flixster.com/1mujOk0a7tRxbxnPBX8NHi1b9YI=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDMwNDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTQ3NjsxOTY4

In 3028, after the Earth is destroyed by an invading alien race, a tiny number of surviving humans roam the universe in ragtag spaceships, trying to find each other and maintain some sense of community. Shortly before the final destruction of the planet, Cale (voice of Matt Damon) was given a map that would guide him to a space station called Titan, secretly constructed as a last hope in the event of alien Armageddon. Cale sets out in search of Titan and the fabled Ice Planet with the help of his friend Korso (voice of Bill Pullman), the beautiful Akima (voice of Drew Barrymore), and a crew of friendly aliens. Titan A.E. was directed by noted animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman and scripted by Ben Edlund, creator of the comic book series The Tick.

Though she is physically unable to perform the pieces the way that she once did, the suggestion to lip-sync to recordings of her previous performances offers a tentative chance for latter day fame.

When he dies, he passes along his ship, a crew of bandits, and one third of a treasure map (which happens to be tattooed on his skull). Morgan is eager to search out the rest of the map and retrieve the riches, but the fragment she holds is in Latin. Morgan then buys a well-educated slave, William Shaw (Matthew Modine), who can read the ancient language and already has a taste for the criminal life. However, Morgan and William are not long into their search when they discover that someone else is following the same trail for the rest of the treasure map: Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), Morgan's uncle and as black-hearted a scurvy dog as ever boarded a ship. As Morgan and Dawg battle each other over the fragments of the map, a British journalist (Maury Chaykin) covers their feud for the penny press.

And, of course, there is the annual JROTC statewide competition, which the kids are obligated to win before the movie can end.

Powers (once again played by Mike Myers), a 1960s superspy stranded in the 1990s, discovers that his nemesis, criminal genius Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), has somehow stolen his ""mojo"" (the secret to his otherwise inexplicable sex appeal) and traveled back in time to the 1960s as part of his latest fiendish scheme. Powers must also travel back in time to retrieve it, but if Austin doesn't quite fit into 1998, he's been there just long enough not to fit in in 1968 anymore, either. Powers also discovers that Dr. Evil has new allies this time: Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a clone of Dr. Evil one-eighth his size but just as nasty; Fat Bastard (Myers yet again), whose name describes him just fine; and vixenish assassin Robin Swallows (Gia Carides). Powers' lack of mojo also proves troublesome when he's paired with his new partner, saucy CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Other characters returning from the first film include Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Seth Green as Scott Evil, and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me also includes cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Jerry Springer, Woody Harrelson, and Burt Bacharach with his current songwriting partner, Elvis Costello. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Jay Roach;Mike Myers,Michael McCullers;/celebrity/mike_myers,/celebrity/michael_mccullers;as Austin Powers/Dr. Evil/Fat Bastard,as Felicity Shagwell,as Scott Evil,as Basil Exposition,as No. 2,as Young No. 2,as Frau Farbissina,as Mini-Me,as Vanessa Kensington,as Ivana Humpalot,as Robin Swallows,as Johnson,as Mustafa,as Gen.

First a group of muggers try to take advantage of Jeff as he walks down the street with his baby in tow. Jeff teaches the boys a humiliating lesson, but one of the creepy bad guys, Muerte (Stanley Tucci), vows revenge, and he spends the rest of the movie dogging Jeff and Jane and getting kicked in the teeth in the process. But Muerte is small potatoes compared to Novacek (Fiona Shaw), a former Czech agent. Convinced to return to work by their superiors, Jeff and Jane have to catch Novacek red-handed buying illegal explosives from a New Orleans traitor so that the government can send her back to the Czech republic.;Herbert Ross;Ian Abrams;/celebrity/ian_abrams;as Jane Blue,as Jeff Blue,as Novacek,as Muerte,as Det.

Forced by circumstances to leave her loathsome son (John Heard) and daughter-in-law (Carlin Glynn), elderly Geraldine Page wants nothing more out of life than to return to her home town of Bountiful. Escaping from her family's clutches, Page boards a bus to Bountiful, where she makes the acquaintance of young Rebecca DeMornay. The two women immediately hit it off, and their trip is a most pleasant one. Eventually, sheriff Richard Bradford, ordered to find Page and bring her back to her family, catches up with the old woman just 12 miles from Bountiful. Feeling sorry for Page, Bradford permits her to complete her sentimental journey, even though he knows full well that Bountiful is now a ghost town of empty ruins and dilapidated shacks. It doesn't matter, though: Page sees Bountiful just as it was when she left it, and for the first time in years she is truly happy and at peace with herself. After several near-misses, Geraldine Page finally won an Academy Award for A Trip to Bountiful (incidentally, the original TV production, which still exists in kinescope form, starred Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint).;Peter Masterson;Horton Foote;/celebrity/horton_foote;as Carrie Watts,as Ludie Watts,as Jessie Mae,as Thelma,as Sheriff,as Roy,as Rosella,as Ticket Man #1,as Stationmaster,as Family on the bus,as Bus Ticket Man,as Family on the bus,as Ticket Agent,as Family on the bus,as Billy Davis,as Bus Passenger,as Downstairs Neighbor,as Mexican Man,as Billy Davis,as Twin,as Twin,as Drugstore Waitress,as Doctor,as Bus Station Derelict,as News Vendor,as Newspaper Boy,as Blonde on Bus,as Man on Bus,as Newspaper Boy,as Young Carrie Watts,as Young Ludie Watts,as Young Ludie Watts,as Bus Station Derelict,as Family Member on Bus,as Family Member on Bus,as Family Member on Bus,as Family Member on Bus;The Trip to Bountiful;https://resizing.flixster.com/lcDWVAapDDLRqMAC9r7ePf2R51U=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwNDI4OTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

American activist Charles Horman (John Shea), who has been a thorn in the side of the country's military ever since his arrival, suddenly disappears. In trying to find out what has happened, his wife Beth (Sissy Spacek) is stonewalled, not only by the ruling junta but by the American consulate. His father, staunchly patriotic Ed Horman (Jack Lemmon), joins Beth in her search. Ed and his daughter-in-law have never seen eye to eye politically, and he refuses to entertain the notion that his son's disappearance might be part of a larger conspiracy or cover-up. But as the days grow into weeks, Ed comes to the shattering conclusion that he and his family have been betrayed by the American government, on behalf of the ""friendly"" South American dictator who holds his people in a grip of iron. Adapted by Costa-Gavras and Donald E. Stewart from a book by Thomas Hauser, Missing was inspired by the true story of the late Charles Horman. In spite of (or perhaps because of) condemnation from certain high-ranking officials in the Reagan administration, the film went on to win an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Actress.";Costa-Gavras;Mildred Lewis,Donald Stewart,John Nichols,Costa-Gavras,Costa-Gavras,Donald E.

Freeman is real-life high school principal Joe Clark, a tough, harsh educator and administrator who in 1987 is given a nearly impossible task by his old friend, school superintendent Dr. Frank Napier (Robert Guillaume). Clark is asked to reform inner city Eastside High School in Paterson, NJ, a hotbed of delinquent kids and drug dealers. Considered the worst school in New Jersey, the state is threatening to take control of Eastside away from the local school board. If Clark can straighten out Eastside in time to get the school's basic-skills test scores up, he can have the job permanently.

Taken from Erich Segal's best selling novel, Jenny (Ali MacGraw) is the Radcliffe student of modest means who has worked hard to excel academically. Oliver Barrett IV (Ryan O'Neal) is the son of a wealthy but coldhearted father (Ray Milland). After graduating from law school, he takes a job at a prestigious law firm and moves in with Jenny. She tries to make a living as a vocal instructor as they both try to make it without outside economic help. Jenny soon is diagnosed with an incurable disease and inflicts the meaningless catch phrase from the film ""Love means never having to say you're sorry"" at least seven times. To date, no one has been able to fully explain the meaning behind this insipid statement that set an entire generation into denial and into therapy about feelings, wants and needs. The film was a box office smash that was nominated for seven Academy Awards, but only the music took home the coveted Oscar. Look for Tommy Lee Jones in an early role as one of Oliver's college chums.

She gets a job waiting tables at the Spitfire Grill and rents a room above it. The cafe proprietor is the irritable Hannah Ferguson. Friendliness is not a word used to describe Gilead and the locals are suspicious of Percy. That she does not conceal her incarceration does not help them warm to her. This gentle drama tinged with joy and sadness centers on the relationships between Percy, the townsfolk and the Spitfire Grill. One day Hannah suffers a bad fall and is forced to bed to recover. To help her, shrewd local businessman Nahum Goddard, whose biggest concern is preserving the character of the town so as to attract renewed interest in an abandoned granite quarry, sends his introverted wife, Shelby to help Percy at the Grill. His ulterior motive is to have Shelby spy on her and report anything strange, but Shelby and Percy instead become good friends.

Based on the acclaimed novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, published posthumously in 1958 and subsequently translated into all European languages, the picture opens as Salina (Burt Lancaster) learns that Garibaldi's troops have embarked in Sicily. While the Prince sees the event as an obvious threat to his current social status, his opportunistic nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon) becomes an officer in Garibaldi's army and returns home a war hero. Tancredi starts courting the beautiful Angelica (Claudia Cardinale), a daughter of the town's newly appointed Mayor, Don Calogero Sedara (Paolo Stoppa). Though the Prince despises Don Calogero as an upstart who made a fortune on land speculation during the recent social upheaval, he reluctantly agrees to his nephew's marriage, understanding how much this alliance would mean for the impecunious Tancredi. Painfully realizing the aristocracy's obsolescence in the wake of the new class of bourgeoisie, the Prince later declines an offer from a governmental emissary to become a senator in the new Parliament in Turin. The closing section, an almost hour-long ball, is often cited as one of the most spectacular sequences in film history. Burt Lancaster is magnificent in the first of his patriarchal roles, and the rest of the cast, especially Delon and Cardinale, become almost perfect incarnations of the novel's characters. Filmed in glorious Techniscope and rich in period detail, the film is a remarkable cinematic achievement in all departments. The version that won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival ran 205 minutes. Inexplicably, the picture was subsequently distributed by 20th Century Fox in a poorly dubbed, 165-min. English-language version, using inferior color process. The restored Italian-language version, supervised by cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno, appeared in 1990, though the longest print still ran only 187 minutes. ~ Yuri German, Rovi;Luchino Visconti;Suso Cecchi d'Amico,Luchino Visconti,Enrico Medioli,Pasquale Festa Campanile,Massimo Franciosa;/celebrity/1058994-suso_cecchi_damico,/celebrity/luchino_visconti,/celebrity/enrico_medioli,/celebrity/pasquale_festa_campanile,/celebrity/massimo_franciosa;as Prince Don Fabrizio Salina,as Tancredi Falconeri,as Angelica Sedara/Bertiana,as Maria Stella,as Don Calogero,as Padre,as Don Ciccio,as Francesco,as Tutor,as Concetta,as Carolina,as Caterina,as Paolo,as Governess Mademoiselle Dombreuil,as Count Cayriaghi,as Cavalier Chevally,as Mariannina,as Youngest Daughter,as Little Prince,as Garibaldino General,as Don Onofrio Rotolo,as Don Diego,as Donna Margherita,as Col.

What Paige doesn't know is that Eddie is in fact the spoiled son of the King (James Fox) and Queen (Miranda Richardson) of Denmark, on holiday in America hoping to find a nonstop keg party complete with buxom American babes. What he and his butler don't count on is squalid dorm life, final exams, and the possibility that Eddie might actually find his true soul mate in the sensible Paige.

Clyde Williams (Poitier) and Billy Foster (Cosby) want to help raise funds to sustain the Sons and Daughters of Shaka Lodge, their local community group. Given that Clyde was trained as a hypnotist while in the military, the pair decide to con mobster Biggie Smalls (Calvin Lockhart) by placing a high-stakes bet on a boxing match and then using hocus-pocus to transform skinny underdog Bootney Farnsworth (Jimmie Walker) into a bruiser. When Biggie finds out about their ruse, he and his thugs move in to reclaim their money, setting the stage for further laughs and sleight-of-hand. With a supporting cast that includes Denise Nicholas and Lee Chamberlin as the protagonists' wives and Ossie Davis as an elder at their lodge, Let's Do It Again also reunited Good Times stars Walker and John Amos to the silver screen. Cosby and Poitier would return two years later with A Piece of the Action, though Lockhart, another veteran of Uptown Saturday Night, would sit out the final team-up.

When Sing attempts to rob a crowded run-down apartment complex known as Pig Sty Alley, the locals begin to defend themselves with some high-flying kung fu skills, and a tiny war erupts between the local masters and the axe-wielding gang. After the gang busts the ancient kung fu king known as The Beast (Leung Siu Lung) out of jail, tensions reach a boiling point as Pig Sty Alley's landlady (Yuen Qiu) leads an all-out attack against the gang and Sing discovers his true heroic fate.

Having dispatched several of her arch-enemies in the first film, The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues in Kill Bill Vol. 2 on her deadly pursuit of her former partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, who, in a furious assault, attempted to murder her and her unborn child on her wedding day. As The Bride faces off against allies-turned-nemeses Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), she flashes back to the day of her deadly wedding, and we learn of how she was recruited to join the DiVAS, her training under unforgiving martial arts master Pai Mei (Liu Chia-hui), and her relationship with Squad leader Bill (David Carradine), which changed from love to violent hatred. Originally planned as a single film, Kill Bill grew into an epic-scale two-part project totaling more than four hours in length; as with the first film, Kill Bill Vol. 2 includes appearances by genre-film icons Sonny Chiba, Michael Parks, Larry Bishop, and Sid Haig; Wu-Tang Clan producer and turntablist RZA and filmmaker and composer Robert Rodriguez both contributed to the musical score. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi";Quentin Tarantino;Quentin Tarantino;/celebrity/quentin_tarantino;as Beatrix Kiddo/The Bride,as Bill,as Budd,as Elle Driver,as Pai Mei,,as Esteban Vihaio,as B.B.,as Karen,as Tommy Plympton,as Rocket,as Clarita,as Rev.

The story begins with young Wallace, whose father and brother have been killed fighting the English, being taken into the custody of his uncle, a nationalist and pre-Renaissance renaissance man. He returns twenty years later, a man educated both in the classics and in the art of war. There he finds his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), and the two quickly fall in love. There are murmurs of revolt against the English throughout the village, but Wallace remains aloof, wishing simply to tend to his crops and live in peace. However, when his love is killed by English soldiers the day after their secret marriage (held secretly so as to prevent the local English lord from exercising the repulsive right of prima noctae, the privilege of sleeping with the bride on the first night of the marriage), he springs into action and single-handedly slays an entire platoon of foot soldiers. The other villagers join him in destroying the English garrison, and thus begins the revolt against the English in what will eventually become full-fledged war. Wallace eventually leads his fellow Scots in a series of bloody battles that prove a serious threat to English domination and, along the way, has a hushed affair with the Princess of Wales (the breathtaking Sophie Marceau) before his imminent demise. For his efforts, Gibson won the honor of Best Director from the Academy; the movie also took home statuettes for Best Picture, Cinematography, Makeup, and Sound Effects. ~ Jeremy Beday, Rovi";Mel Gibson;Randall Wallace;/celebrity/randall_wallace;as William Wallace,as Princess Isabelle,as Longshanks,as Murron,as Hamish,as Campbell,as Stephen,as Robert the Bruce,as The Leper,as Prince Edward,as Young William,as Malcolm Wallace,as John Wallace,as MacClannough,as Young Murron,as Argyle Wallace,as Elder Stewart,as Phillip,as King's Advisor,as Craig,as Mornay,as Morrison,as Mrs. Morrison,as Bride's Father,as Toothless Girl,as Lord Bottoms,as Smythe,as Priest No. 1,as Priest No. 2,as Magistrate,as Corporal,as Madbaker/Flagman,as MacGregor,as Stewart,as Nicolette,as Lord Dolecroft,as Leper's Caretaker,as Faudron,as Lochlan,as Young Soldier,as Veteran,as Lord Talmadge,as Cheltham,as Balliol,as Governor of York,as York Captain,as English General,as Sean,as Villager,as Farmer,as Drinker No. 1,as Drinker No. 2,as Chief Assassin,as Royal Magistrate,as Jailor,as English Commander;Braveheart;https://resizing.flixster.com/P1BBhkwzFEmHCgmZHa0J1Ar-LLM=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE2ODkyNTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

The film is divided into five sequences that play like blue-toned Eddie Cantor vaudeville sketches -- ""The Dawn of Man,"" ""The Stone Age,"" The Spanish Inquisition,"" ""The Bible,"" and ""The Future."" Also included is a Brooksian depiction of The Last Supper and a long-winded sequence about the French Revolution. The film starts with a 2001: A Space Odyssey parody, narrated by Orson Welles, in which a collection of ape-men learn to stand erect (in more ways than one). The Stone Age reveals the origins of both the first homo sapien and homosexual marriages. Brooks then appears in an Old Testament sequence as Moses, descending from Mount Sinai with three heavy stone tablets bearing the 15 Commandments; after he drops one of these tablets, the laws of God become 10 Commandments. The Roman period picks up with Brooks as Comicus, attempting to get a gig as a ""stand-up philosopher"" at Caesar's Palace. The Spanish Inquisition is a musical production number with monks torturing Jews to lively Broadway musical strains. The final French revolution section is a broad parody of The Man in the Iron Mask story. The film closes with coming attractions of ""History of the World, Part II"" that features a rousing Star Wars parody (anticipating Space Balls) called ""Jews in Space"" that includes a jaunty theme song.";Mel Brooks;RONNY GRAHAM,Mel Brooks;/celebrity/ronny_graham,/celebrity/mel_brooks;as Moses/Comicus/Torquemada/Jacques/Louis XVI,as Emperor Caeser,as Count de Monet,as Empress Nympho,as Madame de Farge,as Swiftus,as Josephus,as Mademoiselle Rimbaud,as Bearnaise,as Marcus Vindictus,as Chief Caveman,as Court Spokesman,as Capt.

Wilhelmina Pang (Michelle Krusiec) is a surgeon living in Manhattan whose mother (Joan Chen) is eager for her to settle down with a nice man and get married. What Ma doesn't know is that Wilhelmina happens to be a lesbian -- or rather, Ma prefers not to acknowledge it, since she once walked in on Wilhelmina and her girlfriend several years before. As it happens, Wilhelmina is looking for someone special in her life, and thinks she may have found her in Vivian (Lynn Chen), a beautiful dancer, but a fear of commitment and a desire to keep her medical career on track is making their relationship problematic. As Wilhelmina tries to get her love life in order, her mother's shifts into crisis mode. Ma, a 48-year-old widow, has just discovered she's pregnant, and her staunchly traditional father (Li Zhiyu) will not allow her back into the home they share until she's married someone respectable. Unwilling to name the father of her baby, Ma is forced to move in with Wilhelmina, and while enduring the emotional roller coaster of pregnancy she is being pressured by friends and relatives to marry Cho (Nathaniel Geng), a sweet but boring man she doesn't especially like.

Billed as ""the ultimate romantic comedy,"" Love Actually involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln), who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), trying to help his lonely stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen (Emma Thompson) tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah (Laura Linney) not-so-secretly pines for a man just a few desks away (Rodrigo Santoro), who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places. A working print of Love Actually premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Michael Hastings, Rovi";Richard Curtis;Richard Curtis;/celebrity/richard_curtis;as Billy Mack,as Prime Minister,as Daniel,as Karen,as Jamie,as Natalie,as Harry,as Sarah,as Juliet,as President of the United States of America,as Rufus,as Karl,as Joe,as Colin Frissell,as Jamie's Girlfriend,as Mia,as John,as Aurelia,as Peter,as Mark,as Annie,as Carol-Anne, American Goddess,as Just Judy,as Natalie's Octopus Brother, Keith,as Carol,as Carla, The Real Friendly One,as Sam,as Engineer,as Daisy, Her Daughter,as Terence, Who's In Charge,as Pat The Housekeeper,as Vicar,as The Wedding Singer,as Guitarist,as Jamie's Bad Brother,as Nancy The Caterer,as Tony,as Movie Director,as Movie Cameraman,as Funeral Priest,as Sam's Grandfather,as Sam's Grandmother,as Family Mourner,as Family Mourner,as Family Mourner,as Family Mourner,as Wedding DJ,as Radio Watford DJ,as Receptionist,as Mikey, DJ Interviewer,as Alex, Deputy Prime Minister,as Jeremy,as Cabinet Minister,as Cabinet Minister,as Cabinet Minister,as Cabinet Minister,as Cabinet Minister,as Ant,as Dec,as Eleonore,as U.S. Expert,as Press Conference Reporter,as Press Conference Reporter,as PM's Secretary,as Natalie's Replacement,as Radio DJ,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Billy's Video Vixen,as Parky,as Michael, Sarah's Brother,as Hospital Patient,as Bernie, Karen's Son,as Language Student,as Language Student,as Language Student,as Language Student,as Language Student,as Wisconsin Taxi Driver,as Barman,as Stacey, American Dreamgirl,as Jeannie, American Angel,as Radio 1 Chart Show DJ,as Record Company Executive,as Jamie's Sister,as Jamie's Mum,as PM's Chauffeur, Terry,as PM's Bodyguard, Gavin,as Harris Street Old Lady,as Harris Street Little Girl,as Her Friend,as Her Friend,as Natalie's Mum,as Natalie's Dad,as John's Brother,as Mr. Trench,as Joanna Anderson,as Mrs. Jean Anderson,as Backing-Singer Teacher,as Mr. Anderson,as Tommy, Carol's Son,as Mr. Barros,as Sophia Barros,as Airport Gate Man,as Airport Guard,as Airport Guard,as Airport Guard,as Airport Guard,as Restaurant Proprietor,as Greta,as Harriet, The Sexy One;Love Actually;https://resizing.flixster.com/P_6CdrRe3wOD6CVO6rJP_f4gbv8=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTE3NDgyMjtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7ODAwOzEyMDA

Jack Lemmon and Julie Andrews star as Harvey and Gillian Fairchild. Harvey is a successful architect who has attained his wealth by flattering his rich clients and compromising his ideals. Although he has everything he could want out of life, he is still unhappy. He looks at himself in the mirror and sees a middle-aged man who hates himself, feels that his children don't love him, and thinks that he is dying. Gillian, a successful singer, tries to bolster his self-confidence so that he can have a wonderful birthday. But she has problems of her own -- she has just returned from her doctor, who has informed her that she may have throat cancer. The doctor won't know for sure until the tests come back on Monday.

That's the 64,000-dollar question in this dark romantic comedy. Colleen (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a woman who is not at all happy with her boyfriend Dick (Johnny Knoxville) -- so unhappy, in fact, that she decides to hire Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.), a hit man, in order to put him out of her life (and everyone else's) once and for all. However, as Colleen negotiates the killing with Daniel, she grows fond of the hired killer, and begins to sense that murder isn't his true calling. Daniel confesses that Colleen is right -- he loves to sing, and wants to put his execution contracts behind him so he can find work as a crooner. Colleen eagerly offers to manage Daniel's musical career, and he agrees to the offer, but there's a catch -- he'll need someone to help him wrap up his last few killings before he can pursue music full time.

tweaks the conventions of the musical genre by mixing a period romance with anachronistic dialogue and songs in the style of his previous Romeo+Juliet (1996). Ewan McGregor stars as Christian, who leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle ÃƒÂ©poque of the late 1890s to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later, including songs by Nirvana, Madonna, the Beatles, and Queen, among others. Loosely based on the opera Orpheus in the Underworld, Moulin Rouge was shown in competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;Baz Luhrmann;Baz Luhrmann,Craig Pearce;/celebrity/baz_luhrmann,/celebrity/craig_pearce;as Satine,as Christian,as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,as Harold Zidler,as Duke,as Green Fairy,as Arabia,as Satie,as Marie,as Nini,as Audrey,as Mome Fromage,as China Doll,as The Doctor,as The Unconscious Argentinian,as Le Chocolat,as Warner,as Le Petomane,as Stage Manager,as Doctor,as The Father,as Landlady,as Man in the Moon,as La Petite Princess,as Conductor,as Orchestra Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Audience Member,as Female Patron,as Fan Bearer,as Fan Bearer,as Fan Bearer,as Fan Bearer,as Fan Bearer,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Seamstress,as Prostitute,as Absinthe Drinker/Guitarist,as Pawnbroker,as Musician,as Musician,as Musician,as Moulin Rouge Girl No. 1,as Moulin Rouge Girl No. 2,as Coach,as Old Crone,as Waiter,as Waiter,as Waiter,as Character Rake,as Character Rake,as Character Rake,as Nervous Nellie,as Slave Trader,as Dancer,as Dancer,as Dancer,as Dancer,as Dancer,as Dancer,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Montmartre Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Paris Dance Team Member,as Latin Dancer,as Cocoliscious Brother,as Cocoliscious Brother,as Twin,as Twin,as La Ko Ka Chau,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Tobasco Brother,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,as Stagehand,;Moulin Rouge!;https://resizing.flixster.com/cFX1yZZkYADQ10fzpIvQyCOpg08=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODQ2OTtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MjE5OTsyOTMy

When terrorists threaten to destroy Paris with a thermonuclear device as they hold reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) hostage, Superman (Christopher Reeve) comes to the rescue and flings the weapon into space. However, its blast outside the earth's orbit awakens Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran), three villains from Superman's home planet of Krypton who were exiled to outer space for their crimes. Zod and his partners arrive on Earth and use their powers in a bid to take over the U.S., and then the world. However, when Lois realizes that mild mannered Clark Kent and Superman are actually the same person, he brings her to his Fortress of Solitude, where his decision to marry Lois costs him his remarkable strength. Without his super powers, how can Superman vanquish Zod and save the world?

Unfortunately, all this visual razzle-dazzle doesn't add up to much. Director Mitsurou Hongo doesn't bother to introduce the characters or the set-up, and Ojhi Hiroi's story has a jingoistic edge. Brent Furlong, the head of the American Douglas-Stewart company, plots to replace the Operetta Troupe Flower Division with his unmanned mecha Japhkiels. His real objective is the conquest of Japan, but he underestimates the young women of the Flower Division, who defeat his mecha and demons. The flat, drawn characters and the 3-D CG mechanical devices look like they're taken from two different films, and the leaden pacing makes the film feel much longer than 85 minutes. The TV series is less flashy but more entertaining.

Ten years later, Kyoya, the man's son, watches in horror as the Federation president is struck down by one of Rebi Ra's minions on live television. Later that evening, as he trains halfheartedly with his own mystic blade, he is visited by the apparation of an old man named Master Rai, who reveals how his father died and exhorts him to go into Shinjuku to fight Rebi Ra before he can extend his reach to the rest of the world, paving the way for a demon invasion. Faced with Kyoya's reluctance, Master Rai sends Sayaka, the Federation president's daughter, to convince him to save her father and the world.

Wong Kei Ying (Donnie Yen) is a master of the Hung Gar style of boxing in mid-19th century China. His son, Wong Fei Hung (Sze-Man Tsang), though still just a boy, will grow up to become a martial arts legend, a nearly mythical figure in Chinese history. When Wong Fei Hung is kidnapped, his father is forced to use his daunting skills in the service of the abductor, a dishonest politician plagued by the Robin Hood-style thief known as Iron Monkey, a mysterious masked avenger stealing from the rich, delivering the spoils to the poor. Wong Fei Hung's only allies are the kindly Dr. Yang (Yu Rong Guang) and Yang's assistant, Orchid (Jean Wang), who are protecting an important secret. Iron Monkey (1993) director Yuen Wo Ping is also the masterful martial arts choreographer behind The Matrix (1999) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000); his father served as action choreographer on a series of popular, long-running films centered around the Wong Fei Hung character in the 1950s. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi";Woo-ping Yuen;Lau Tai-Muk,Cheung Tan,Hark Tsui,Elsa Tang,Tang Pik-Yin;/celebrity/lau_taimuk,/celebrity/cheung_tan,/celebrity/tsui_hark,/celebrity/elsa_tang,/celebrity/tang_pik_yin;as Dr. Yang,as Wong Kei Ying,as Young Wong Fei-Hong,as Orchid,as Chief Fox,as Gov.

Avildsen, director of the Oscar-winning original. Stallone is Rocky Balboa, suffering from career-ending brain damage as a result of his punishing bout with Ivan Drago at the finale of the previous film. Upon their return to Philadelphia, Rocky and his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), discover they are broke, their fortune squandered by an incompetent accountant. Forced to move back to their working-class neighborhood, Rocky finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey (Burgess Meredith, who appears in new flashback sequences). Resisting big money offered to him by Don King-like boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Tommy Morrison, nephew of John Wayne). Rocky's son (played by Stallone's real-life son Sage Stallone) feels neglected by his father, who lavishes attention on his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, but Tommy ultimately turns his back on his mentor to sign a more lucrative deal with Duke, leading to a street-fight showdown.;John G.

To solve the murder and stop the bomber, Wilder teams up with Swanson's partner, a German Shepherd named Reno. At first the new partners do not get along, but eventually they begin working as a team and discover that the culprit was a white-supremacist group. This film stirred up a lot of controversy when it first came out as the distributors exhibited remarkably bad judgment by releasing it two weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing of a Federal building that resulted in the death of close to two hundred innocent people, some of them small children.;Aaron Norris;;;as Jake Wilder,as Capt.

Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man who does not want to stand out in a dangerous world. Even when a woman is attacked outside his Brooklyn window, he remains quiet about what he saw, unwilling to make waves and so fearful, he even begins to question what he truly saw. But then unassuming Newman and his outspoken new wife, Gertrude, become caught up in a case of mistaken identity. Slowly ostracized at home and work, they learn the value of solidarity as they struggle to maintain their dignity while confronting their nation's lurking anti-Semitism. The unwitting focus of his neighbor's prejudice, Newman is faced with a choice: go down as a coward or take a long shot at becoming the unlikeliest of heroes by telling the truth.;Neal Slavin;Kendrew Lascelles;/celebrity/kendrew_lascelles;as Lawrence Newman,as Gertrude Hart,as Finkelstein,as Fred,as Mrs. Newman,as Mrs. Newman,as Carlson,as Father Crighton,as Gargan,as Gargan,as Mrs. Dewitt,as Willy Doyle,as Meeting Hall Man,as Sullivan,as Cole Stevens,as Mel,as Tough's Leader,as 1st Tough,as Petey,as Rape Victim,as Mr. Lorring,as Sergeant,as Policeman,as Billy,as Speaking Woman on Subway,as Mrs. Dewitt's Granddaughter,as Elsie,as 2nd Woman on Subway,as Maid,as Bodyguard,as MP Receptionist,as Green Grocer,as Waitress,as Truck Driver,as Photographer,as Man in Theater,as Woman No.1 in Theater,as Woman No. 2 in Theater;Focus;https://resizing.flixster.com/vBZzhapgJtcYR_n6pxC58DO7tvg=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTIwODQ1MDtqOzE3NTQ0OzEyMDA7MTUzNjsyMDQ4

The year is 1929, and Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is a talented Russian chess player travelling to Como by train for the World Chess Championship. Also on his train is Natalia (Emily Watson), who is journeying to Como to meet her mother Vera (Geraldine James) at their posh lakeside hotel. Vera wants Natalia to settle down with the right -- meaning rich -- man, and duly tries to set her up with Jean (Christopher Thompson), a French count. However, Natalia instead sets her sights on Luzhin, who returns her affections, and the two embark on an unusual and unpredictable love affair. Adapted from one of Vladimir Nabokov's lesser-known novels, The Luzhin Defense also features the talents of Mark Tandy and Kelly Hunter as Luzhin's parents -- seen in flashback -- and Orla Brady as his young aunt. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi;Marleen Gorris;Peter Berry;/celebrity/peter_berry;as Alexander Luzhin,as Natalia,as Vera,as Valentinov,as Jean De Stassard,as Turati,as Ilya,as Anna,as Luzhin's Father,as Luzhin's Mother,,;The Luzhin Defence;https://resizing.flixster.com/rmvntsBC239sHsiGxbQa_xJx_hA=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDc0NDtqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7MzI5OzQ3NQ

Bud Parks (Mellencamp) is a country-rock star who's feeling burned out after a long stretch on the road and heads back to his hometown in Indiana for some downtime with his family and old friends for the occasion of his father's birthday. But after arriving in Indiana with his wife, Alice (Mariel Hemingway), and daughter, Terri Jo (Melissa Ann Hackman), Bud gets a reminder that the Parks family is no more happy or stable than it has ever been. Bud's wealthy father, Speck (Claude Akins), is still a self-centered womanizer; Grandpa (Dub Taylor) is a foul and hateful man; and Bud's half-brother, Ramey (Larry Crane) -- the result of one of Speck's many extramarital affairs -- is much better adjusted than his full brother, Parker (Brent Huff), whose loyalty to Speck has turned him into a spiritless lackey. Parker also happens to be married to P.J. (Kay Lenz), who was Bud's girlfriend in high school, and as Alice sits on the sidelines attracting the unwanted attentions of Speck, Bud finds himself falling into an affair with P.J. As he faces his own guilt and the mixed emotions of his family and friends at his return, Bud realizes he's more like his father than he ever wanted to be. Novelist and screenwriter Larry McMurtry wrote Falling From Grace for Mellencamp, even spending time with the singer in Indiana to get a better feel for the locations; songwriter and Mellencamp collaborator John Prine also appears and contributes to the soundtrack.";John Mellencamp;Larry McMurtry;/celebrity/larry_mcmurtry;as Band Leader,as Bud Parks,as Alice,as Speck,as Grandpa,as P.J.,as Ramey,as Sally,as Linda,as Mitch Cutler,as Parker Parks,as Marian Parks,as Bobby Tucker,as Terri Jo Parks,as Grandma Parks,as Country Club Manager,as Turdis,as Luke,as Mrs. Pendergrass,as Mrs. Sacks,as Checker Girl,as Checker Girl,as Mrs. Green,as Parking Attendant,as Waitress,as P.J.'s Child,as P.J.'s Child,as P.J.'s Child,as P.J.'s Child,as P.J.'s Child,as Sally's Child,as Sally's Child,as Pure Jam Band Member,as Pure Jam Band Member,as Pure Jam Band Member,as Pure Jam Band Member;Falling from Grace;https://resizing.flixster.com/6qWdldHbe-O4bwlLQVRY0edm0_o=/206x305/v1.bTsxMjIwMTM3ODtqOzE3NDY2OzEyMDA7MzQ4OzUwMA

Francesco was based on Hermann Hesse's Francis of Assisi, which director Liliana Cavani had previously filmed in 1966. The Saint and founder of the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor is played by Mickey Rourke, and his inspiration, the woman who later became Saint Clare, is played by Helena Bonham Carter. Raised as the pampered son of a merchant, Francis goes off to war only to return with a profound horror for the society which generated such suffering. In one scene, as an act of renunciation, he strips himself of his fine clothing in front of his father and leaves the house naked and barefoot, joining the lepers and beggars in the poor section of town. The film follows with a series of episodes from the saint's life rather than a coherent narrative, following up until his final days when he receives the stigmata, or wounds similar to those on the body of Jesus at the crucifixion.;Liliana Cavani;Liliana Cavani,Roberta Mazzoni;/celebrity/liliana_cavani,/celebrity/roberta_mazzoni;as Francis of Assisi,as Clare,as Father,as Ugolino,as Angelo Tancredi,as Mother,as Pope Innocent III,as Guido--Bishop of Assisi,as Leone,as Pietro Cattani,as Egidio,as Pacifico,as Rufino,as Bernardo di Quintavalle,as Masseo,as Cardinal Colonna,as Elia Bombarone,as Woman in the Hovels,as Woman in the Hovels,as Woman in the Hovels,as Woman in the Hovels,as Woman in the Hovels,as Woman in the Hovels,as Man in the Hovels,as Man in the Hovels,as Learned Brother,as Learned Brother,as Learned Brother,as Learned Brother,as Learned Brother,as Learned Brother,as New Brother,as New Brother,as New Brother,as Man in Lateran Palace,as Man in Lateran Palace,as Man in Lateran Palace,as Man in Lateran Palace,as Man in Lateran Palace,as Man in Lateran Palace,as Man in Lateran Palace;Francesco;https://resizing.flixster.com/woYS7YWbXkOzBq7ZPIcq81E6MvY=/206x305/v1.bTsxMTYxNDc0NTtqOzE3NTQ5OzEyMDA7NzMwOzEwMzg

While filming along an unchartered slope, Jeffrey's camera crew make an unexpected discovery - they find the secret compound of international terrorist Slobodan Pavlov (Klaus Lowitsch), and even capture the deadly man on videotape.

Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek star as Tom and Mae Garvey, struggling Tennessee farmers constantly one step away from foreclosing. Their farm sits next to a river that both nourishes their land and constantly threatens to overflow its banks and destroy their crops. The Garveys sell some of their equipment for obscenely low prices at a foreclosure auction, at which some of their neighbors are forced to give up everything they own. The stoic Tom takes a job as a scab at a mill where the union workers are striking. Meanwhile, Mae has a platonic flirtation with local bank manager Joe (Scott Glenn), who saves her life when she's trapped under a heavy piece of farm equipment. Tom's homecoming is cut short by a flood, but the raging waters allow him to become a hero to his family again. The River was the third in a trio of dramas depicting the plight of the American family farmer released that same year. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi;Mark Rydell;Robert Dillon,Julian Barry;/celebrity/robert_dillon,/celebrity/julian_barry;as Tom Garvey,as Mae Garvey,as John Wade,as Lewis Garvey,as Beth Garvey,as Sen.
